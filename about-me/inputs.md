One of my favorite definitions of humility if from scholar and author John Dickson:[9](https://substack.com/home/post/p-145662643#footnote-9-145662643)

“Humility is the noble choice to forgo your status and to use your influence for the good of others before yourself.”

If character is a tree, humility is the roots. The deeper the roots, the stronger your character. Nurture your character tree by reading and critical self-reflection.

With universal values,

* we can **connect** with others through our **shared humanity**,
* we can **transcend differences** to find **common ground**, and
* we can **co-create** to **solve problems** together.

Remember, be consistent and reliable and keep all promises and commitments.

“I'm not interested in resolving it. I’m also not interested in avoiding it, ... My goal, as a journalist and as a human, is if I can do one of three things: Can I, myself, understand the other **person**, the **problem**, or **myself** a little better through this encounter?”
