# Cognitive Biases, Simple Errors

{% hint style="info" %}
Smart, creative and intelligent people think a lot. Yet they are also fallible to cognitive dissonance, behavioral biases and prejudices. Humans are normally gullible and credulous, no one of us can deny falling prey to reasoning errors or flaws in the reasoning. Humans are fallible and susceptible to making errors, unless they learn to be critical and careful in making sound arguments.

In 2017, December, I was at the Changi Airport wandering and got into a bookshop WH Smith. I took a book read the book cover  jacket. I could immediately recognise that this give me a lot of language. vocabulary, analogies and anecdotes to cutshort many decision making debates I involve day-to-day. I bought the book The Art of Thinking Clearly(TAoTC). The Book later introduced a lot of resources I now follow.&#x20;
