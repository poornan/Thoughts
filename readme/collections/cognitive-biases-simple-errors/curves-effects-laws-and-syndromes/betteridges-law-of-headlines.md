# Betteridge's law of headlines

> Betteridge's Law of Headlines is an adage stating that if a news headline ends with a question mark, the answer to the question is almost always "no". Coined by journalist [Ian Betteridge](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG951SG953\&cs=0\&sca_esv=adfd38bc1a36b954\&sxsrf=AE3TifOJblRD8zsu7ZbQoAiMQ9UlG6tAHg%3A1756723334355\&q=Ian+Betteridge\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwiimoWysLePAxVz4jgGHVxCJ0IQxccNegQIBBAB\&mstk=AUtExfBaE8pYyXGuuKvCRei3vMmI20NhTTIxtkDWD_9oTfXci1v26UUAeBSUD2amyEZjSk4o4GLTwx7ClNzCMYj7EbvElfchm1d9Mb5UbwIvZTJjFwwcXR15tqZX3TZPEnDTU2-jQpwrN3FbkJWjIoHZDgk7fSocOzLm4irUFpp5yfBIn4k\&csui=3) in 2009, the law suggests that such headlines often imply doubt about the subject's validity or positive outcome. While the law primarily applies to direct, yes/no questions, it's a cynical observation about the potential for journalists to use questions to mask uncertainty or a lack of definitive answers. Key Aspects of Betteridge's Law:
>
> * **Focus on Yes/No Questions:**&#x54;he law is most applicable to headlines that are phrased as simple questions with a likely negative or uncertain answer, such as "Is the New Product a Success?".&#x20;
> * **Journalistic Intent:**&#x54;he law highlights a possible trend where journalists might use question headlines to imply the story's content is questionable, or to generate clicks by posing a provocative, yet ultimately negative, inquiry.&#x20;
> * **Not a Strict Rule:**&#x57;hile often true, it's not a definitive rule; some question headlines can genuinely seek positive or open-ended information from the reader.&#x20;
>
> Example:&#x20;
>
> * A headline like "Will the Company Avoid Bankruptcy?" is a classic example where Betteridge's Law suggests the answer is likely "no".
>
> In essence, Betteridge's Law is a commentary on journalistic practice, suggesting that a headline asking a direct question is often a signal of doubt rather than a genuine query.&#x20;
