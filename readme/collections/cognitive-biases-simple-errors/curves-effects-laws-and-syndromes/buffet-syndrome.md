# Buffet syndrome

"Buffet syndrome" describes the overconsumption of healthcare services driven by extensive, zero-co-payment insurance coverage, similar to how diners at a buffet eat beyond their capacity because the price is fixed. This phenomenon, prominent in Singapore's healthcare system, leads to overuse of treatments and tests, increasing overall costs for insurers and consumers, and potentially straining limited medical resources. How it works:

* **Zero or Low Co-payment:**&#x57;hen an [Integrated Shield Plan](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0341e61adf0435df\&rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG951SG953\&cs=0\&sxsrf=AE3TifMg7tKjlv2JnPtNXewZxTD274c7ww%3A1756732566599\&q=Integrated+Shield+Plan\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwi9r6zk0rePAxXbWXADHfeTLS0QxccNegQIFBAB\&mstk=AUtExfC2SPtcfwerq1TmilBkgIuyN-spkvw2iH3l6hFZlRXDpHIGcD8cHeE-Ld2IXGkoYX_Q6KxYZztaaNCLBM88TBUKnTNvdEEY0Ilt7H7qcoCdNWnxhrRNRNZybW2O2wCm-6EMSNdte3hkaiperjaaH3Dm6mLepX6_x_V8SlePglJxZhpSzbvBMi4Wpgrgudd4MAvHzk5Nk6139-uB99RaWQ27pi6J0sh0cNlysO3R44HkpLhTI4W5LEd8Tailh0IGTV9MANVe5QBO5jBWFKLdsxiw\&csui=3) or rider covers nearly the entire cost of treatment, patients perceive the service as "free" or heavily subsidized.&#x20;
* **Moral Hazard:**&#x54;his lack of direct cost incentivizes patients to request more or more expensive services than they might if they had to pay a significant portion of the bill.&#x20;
* **Over-servicing:**&#x48;ealthcare providers might also respond by ordering more diagnostic tests and prescribing costlier treatments, knowing the insurer will pay.&#x20;
* **Rising Costs:**&#x54;he combined effect is increased healthcare consumption, which leads to higher claims for insurers, higher premiums for all policyholders, and greater strain on healthcare resources.&#x20;

Example:Imagine a patient with a fully comprehensive health rider visiting a doctor. Instead of focusing solely on the most necessary treatment, the patient might be more inclined to ask for additional tests or consider a private room if the insurance will cover it. This behavior is a direct parallel to eating more food at an all-you-can-eat buffet simply because it's available at a set price. \
