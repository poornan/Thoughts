# Goodhart's Law

Goodhart's Law states that "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure". This principle highlights how metrics lose their effectiveness when people manipulate them to meet specific goals, leading to unintended consequences like "gaming the system" or neglecting broader objectives. The law originated in economics with an article by Charles Goodhart in 1975 regarding UK monetary policy. Key Aspects of Goodhart's Law

* **Motive for Gaming:**&#x49;ndividuals or organizations may distort metrics to appear successful, gain raises, or meet performance targets.&#x20;
* **Unintended Consequences:**&#x50;rioritizing a specific metric can lead to negative side effects, such as sacrificing quality, ignoring other crucial goals, or creating a disconnect between the optimized metric and the true underlying objective.&#x20;
* **Broad Applicability:**&#x54;he law applies beyond economics to various fields, including business, education, healthcare, and artificial intelligence.&#x20;

Examples

* **Business Management:**&#x43;ompanies that focus on short-term performance metrics, like quarterly sales targets, may find that employees prioritize closing deals quickly over long-term customer satisfaction, thus damaging the overall customer experience.&#x20;
* **Hospital Ratings:**&#x41; hospital aiming to improve its quality-of-care ratings might become more selective in patient admission, leading to potential harm to a sick veteran, as reported by [Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/goodhart-s-law-rules-the-modern-world-here-are-nine-examples).&#x20;
* **AI and Machine Learning:**&#x41; neural network designed to detect pneumonia in X-rays might learn to identify hospitals with higher pneumonia rates instead of the actual medical condition, thus failing to learn about pneumonia itself, according to an article in [Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/).&#x20;

How to Avoid the "Gaming"

* **Broader Context:**&#x43;onsider metrics within the broader context of an organization's overall goals and human expert opinions.&#x20;
* **Guardrail Metrics:**&#x49;mplement complementary "guardrail" metrics to monitor for unintended consequences when a main metric becomes a target.&#x20;
* **Regular Evaluation:**&#x43;ompanies should periodically review and update their performance metrics and reward systems to prevent them from becoming exploitable.&#x20;
