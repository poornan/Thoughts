# Pygmalion Effect, Self-fulfilling Prophecy

The Pygmalion effect is a specific type of self-fulfilling prophecy, where higher expectations lead to better performance, and lower expectations lead to worse performance. For example, teachers' positive beliefs about a student's potential can lead the student to achieve more, while a manager's low expectations for an employee can result in the employee underperforming, fulfilling the initial expectation. This effect highlights how our beliefs and expectations influence our behavior and the behavior of others, creating a circular process that shapes outcomes. How it Works

1. **1. Belief:**&#x41; person (e.g., a manager or teacher) forms an expectation or belief about another person's abilities.&#x20;
2. **2. Treatment:**&#x54;he person holding the expectation then acts on this belief, often unconsciously, through their behavior.&#x20;
3. **3. Behavior:**&#x54;he target person perceives this treatment and, as a result, changes their own behavior to align with the expectations placed upon them.&#x20;
4. **4. Outcome:**&#x54;he target person's performance or behavior ultimately confirms the initial expectation, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy.&#x20;

Examples in Different Contexts

* **Education:**&#x54;eachers who are told a student is a "high-potential" learner tend to treat them differently, giving them more attention and challenging them more. This often results in the student actually performing better and improving their scores, validating the teacher's high expectations.&#x20;
* **Management:**&#x4D;anagers who expect their subordinates to perform well may provide more challenging tasks and positive feedback, leading to increased motivation and better performance from the subordinates. Conversely, low expectations can lead to less support and ultimately poorer results.&#x20;

Key Takeaways

* **Expectations Matter:**&#x4F;ur expectations, whether high or low, can significantly influence the performance and achievements of others.&#x20;
* **Unconscious Influence:**&#x54;his effect often occurs unconsciously, meaning people may not realize their expectations are shaping their behavior and the outcomes of others.&#x20;
* **Positive Impact:**&#x42;y fostering positive and realistic high expectations, leaders and educators can create environments that encourage individuals to achieve their full potential.&#x20;
