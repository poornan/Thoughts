# Tragedy of the commons

The "Tragedy of the Commons" is an economic theory describing how individuals, acting in their own self-interest, will overutilize and deplete a shared, finite resource, ultimately harming the collective good and the resource itself. This occurs because the cost of using the resource is borne by all, while the benefit goes to the individual, creating an incentive to consume more than what is sustainable. Classic examples include overfishing, deforestation, and air pollution.\
&#x20;Key Aspects

* **Shared Resource:**&#x54;he "commons" is a resource (like a pasture, air, or fish stocks) that is available to many individuals without private ownership.&#x20;
* **Individual Self-Interest:**&#x45;ach individual user has a rational incentive to maximize their own gain by taking as much as they can from the resource.&#x20;
* **Depletion and Ruin:**&#x57;hen many individuals act on this incentive, the shared resource becomes overused, depleted, or degraded.&#x20;

Origin

* The concept was popularized by Garrett Hardin in a 1968 article in [Science](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=24998f3a4070201e\&rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG951SG953\&sxsrf=AE3TifMPT1-IQJat4y_849aeJfYaoMF8MA%3A1756732344594\&q=Science\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwjKufX60bePAxU6xDgGHWdlOa0QxccNegUIqQEQAQ\&mstk=AUtExfCkrK5JY_CbiL5fqGif3ahbc8dR0k5QmMw-U0zbkOvVuBpGCuy5stbrKm7D0TbqHS-Lbh_y7qh6eMHoYs7dPfJ5TTm4HP2UYwPu-7SAtZZVziF9VH_UjO97j72i_-_pb0sjL8MsyFLnkQJmgTezbM0ZFrKsxT_UK4cMxP6NdswriP4T1pizKU9RFVZVFN8bws4T1v7zYwj19qUCJPngcE4fxrbTtIX8pohyxrkHlad0gpwZS9rYb3ElRnE-gyxi0p73HlcJVRcT3i0BRVnyvbQG\&csui=3).&#x20;
* However, the idea originated from an earlier 1833 essay by British economist William Forster Lloyd, who used the example of herders on a common pasture.&#x20;

Examples

* **Overfishing:**&#x57;ithout regulation, fishermen may catch as many fish as possible, depleting fish populations for everyone in the long run.&#x20;
* **Deforestation:**&#x49;ndividuals may cut down trees for farming or logging without fully accounting for the shared loss of forest resources.&#x20;
* **Air Pollution:**&#x43;ompanies may release pollutants into the atmosphere, as the cost of pollution is spread among the entire population, rather than being borne by the polluter alone.&#x20;

Solutions

While the concept highlights a pessimistic outcome, it's not inevitable. Solutions often involve:&#x20;

* **Regulation:**&#x49;mplementing rules, limits, and sanctions to govern the use of shared resources.&#x20;
* **Property Rights:**&#x41;ssigning private ownership to a resource, which can then create a stronger incentive for conservation.&#x20;
