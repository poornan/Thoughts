Named after economist [William Stanley Jevons](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=5b71cfa89013eb9f\&rlz=1C5CHFA_enSG951SG953\&sxsrf=AE3TifOZipHTNefRlpw60hENkUTTG7EdPQ%3A1757930383678\&q=William+Stanley+Jevons\&sa=X\&ved=2ahUKEwjah7yAwdqPAxVSxzgGHTHIAwwQxccNegQILBAB\&mstk=AUtExfA4xJywA_9IKQoI48pDsVcOJrT0cqG-JMZ6Tpx_3QKwxeCWXhtcto4pl9cQpuMeDkMVFODN27hgncKoMxiFjU1otBKt6ShUI1ErdJt5CFMk7EEfedjyb6AOP-F6LYEv_ff1rYChW6KLJX4a2Yd34rhG5zhkj3aUqsGpv_Jmywke-77wZbS7t8nTJJujz3r7dcIaJ2767lRzYOyn4fXpXW_pelXT_mpGIKIWk-QmwvtGFwbUlYcBLhlMArOTh31h8s11U18JvrxH1Sj-v5donhTj\&csui=3), this occurs because efficiency improvements lower the cost per unit of the resource, which stimulates greater demand and potentially new uses, ultimately increasing total consumption. A classic example is how more efficient steam engines led to increased coal use because it made coal a cheaper energy source, driving broader industrial growth. &#x20;

> How it Works
>
> 1. **1. Technological Progress & Efficiency:**&#x41; new technology is developed that makes it more efficient to use a resource.&#x20;
> 2. **2. Lower Costs:**&#x54;he increased efficiency makes the resource cheaper to use per unit of output.&#x20;
> 3. **3. Increased Demand:**&#x42;ecause it's cheaper, more people and industries begin using the resource, and existing users consume more of it.&#x20;
> 4. **4. Overall Consumption Rises:**&#x54;he increased demand from broader use and new applications can outweigh the efficiency gains per unit, leading to a higher total consumption of the resource.&#x20;

> * **The Paradox:** Instead of coal consumption decreasing, its use skyrocketed.&#x20;
> * **The Reason:** The lower cost of energy from more efficient engines spurred economic growth and the development of new industries and transportation, which required vast amounts of coal.&#x20;
>
> Modern Implications
>
> * **Digital Technology:**&#x45;ven though individual computers and data centers are more efficient, the explosion in their numbers and usage has led to a substantial increase in overall energy demand.&#x20;
> * **Fuel-Efficient Cars:**&#x43;heaper-to-run vehicles might encourage people to drive more miles or buy more cars, increasing total fuel consumption despite the better mileage per mile.&#x20;
