# Good fences make good neighbors

{% hint style="info" %}
This chapter establishes two typologies, one based on power laws and the other on complex adaptive systems theory, to provide a basis for understanding systems where it not possible to reduce uncertainty, only to absorb it. Those typologies are used to establish a framework within which different approaches to foresight can be distinguished. These range from systems models, through scenario planning to more recent techniques utilizing attractor landscapes and distributed cognition.
