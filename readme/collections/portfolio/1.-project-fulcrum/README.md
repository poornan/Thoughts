# 1. Project—Fulcrum

Singapore's Government Electronic Business (GeBIZ) was a pioneering procurement system for the internet era. However, technology and strategy have advanced through several generations since its inception. This evolution represents more than just a name change; it signifies a fundamental shift in how we achieve our goals.

Consider the evolution of communication: from a bird carrying mail, to a postman, to email and instant messaging, and now to AI assistants. In each step, the core purpose—delivering a message—remained the same, but the method and capabilities were completely transformed.

Similarly, the future of government procurement lies not in just another electronic system, but in a true "[platform](../../books/platform-revolution-how-networked-markets-are-transforming-the-economy-1-april-2016.md)." Guided by the principles of a "[Platform Strategy](../../books/platform-strategy-innovation-through-harmonization-architect-elevator-book-series-2-april-2024.md)," this approach moves beyond simple transactions. A modern platform connects and integrates disparate systems and stakeholders, fostering an open ecosystem that avoids vendor lock-in. It is designed to enable, not just to control.

With this vision, I am conceptualizing a next-generation procurement platform for governments and intergovernmental organizations like ASEAN. The objective is to create a unified system that allows different countries to collaborate, streamline their processes, and [realize collective benefits](digital-government-procurement-transforming-governance-for-700-million-lives.md).
