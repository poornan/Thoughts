# Government procurement is fundamental to both statehood and good governance in several critical ways

### Government procurement is fundamental to both statehood and good governance in several critical ways:

### Foundation of State Capacity

Public procurement refers to the purchase by governments and state-owned enterprises of goods, services and works. It is a crucial pillar of services delivery for governments. [Public procurement | OECD](https://www.oecd.org/gov/public-procurement/) This seemingly mundane function is actually one of the most essential elements of state capacity. Without effective procurement, hospitals wait for drugs [Three Reasons Procurement is Essential for Development](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/governance/three-reasons-procurement-essential-development), schools lack textbooks, infrastructure projects stall, and basic government services fail to function. The state's ability to deliver on its fundamental promises to citizens depends entirely on effective procurement systems.

### Scale and Economic Impact

Government procurement typically represents 10-15% of GDP in most countries, making it one of the largest economic activities any state undertakes. As it accounts for a large share of the taxpayers' money, governments are expected to carry it out efficiently and with high standards of integrity to ensure the quality-of-service delivery and safeguard the public interest. [Public procurement | OECD](https://www.oecd.org/gov/public-procurement/) This massive scale means procurement decisions directly impact economic development, market competition, and resource allocation across society.

### Legitimacy and Trust

Procurement serves as a critical test of government legitimacy. A large majority, 84% of Filipinos, want action against corruption, showing that accountability is very important. [The Importance of Good Governance and Transparency in the Philippines - Geo Pinas](https://geopinas.com/good-governance-and-transparency/) When procurement processes are transparent, fair, and efficient, they build public trust. When they're corrupt or inefficient, they undermine the social contract between state and citizens. The way governments handle procurement often becomes a proxy for overall governance quality in public perception.

### Core Governance Principles

Governance in procurement refers to the overall procedural arrangements and systems established to ensure that the adopted procurement processes allow appropriate levels of control and probity. [What is Governance in Procurement? Its Model | GEP Glossary](https://www.gep.com/knowledge-bank/glossary/what-is-governance-in-procurement) Effective procurement systems embody and enforce fundamental governance principles:

* **Transparency**: Open processes that citizens can scrutinize
* **Accountability**: Clear responsibility for decisions and outcomes
* **Fairness**: Equal treatment of suppliers and competitive processes
* **Efficiency**: Maximizing value from public resources
* **Integrity**: Preventing corruption and conflicts of interest

### Market Development and Economic Policy

Government procurement serves as a powerful policy tool for economic development. States can use procurement to support small businesses, promote innovation, encourage sustainable practices, or develop strategic industries. This makes procurement not just about buying goods and services, but about shaping economic development and market structures.

### International Relations and Sovereignty

In the context of projects like the Fulcrum platform discussed in the document, procurement becomes a vehicle for international cooperation and regional integration. Collaborative procurement systems can strengthen diplomatic ties, create economic interdependencies, and build shared governance norms across borders.

### Institutional Development

Strong procurement systems require and reinforce broader institutional capabilities: legal frameworks, regulatory systems, professional civil service, audit mechanisms, and democratic oversight. The development of procurement capacity often drives broader state-building efforts.

The importance of procurement to statehood explains why the Fulcrum project's vision of a regional platform is so significant. By creating systems that enable more effective, transparent, and collaborative procurement, such platforms could strengthen not just individual governments but the entire fabric of regional governance and cooperation. Poor procurement undermines state effectiveness; excellent procurement can be transformative for governance quality and citizen welfare.
