## Analysis of Inflated Road Construction Costs in Sri Lanka Post-Civil War (2009 Onwards)

### 1. Introduction: Context of Post-Conflict Infrastructure Development in Sri Lanka

Following the conclusion of the civil war in 2009, Sri Lanka embarked on an ambitious national development agenda, placing significant emphasis on large-scale infrastructure projects, particularly expressways. This strategic focus aimed to stimulate economic growth, enhance connectivity, and facilitate national integration. The post-conflict period witnessed a substantial influx of foreign investment and loans, with China emerging as a primary project lender and contractor for much of the new infrastructure.<sup>1</sup>

The imperative for rapid development in the aftermath of a protracted conflict created a powerful political and economic impetus. This urgency, coupled with the substantial inflows of foreign capital, particularly from China, which often involved direct contracting that bypassed traditional tender processes, inadvertently fostered an environment susceptible to reduced oversight and increased opportunities for rent-seeking.<sup>1</sup> The perceived need for swift results may have led to a relaxation or circumvention of stringent procurement regulations, allowing less transparent methods to become prevalent. This combination of developmental urgency and a lack of robust institutional safeguards transformed a legitimate national need into a significant vulnerability for potential financial irregularities.

This report aims to conduct a comprehensive examination of the accusations surrounding inflated road construction costs in Sri Lanka, specifically focusing on expressways built after 2009. It will systematically identify key projects, quantify cost disparities against international benchmarks, analyze the underlying mechanisms of alleged corruption, and assess the broader economic and social impacts on the nation.

### 2. Identification of Key Expressway Projects and Cost Data

This section details major expressway projects undertaken in Sri Lanka since 2009, providing available cost data, including total cost and cost per kilometer, and highlighting reported discrepancies or adjusted figures.

#### 2.1. Southern Expressway (SEG)

The Southern Expressway was one of the earliest major post-conflict road infrastructure projects. Its initial phases, specifically the 95-kilometer stretch from Kottawa to Pinnaduwa, were financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Japan.<sup>3</sup> This section cost US$ 741.1 million or Rs 96.8 billion, translating to approximately US$ 7.8 million or Rs 1 billion per kilometer.<sup>3</sup> This figure is often cited as a benchmark for relatively lower costs compared to later projects, with some reports noting it as US$ 7 million per kilometer.<sup>4</sup> Loan details from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) indicate approved amounts of 18,770 million yen and 17,499 million yen for Phase I and II, with China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Taisei Corporation as main contractors.<sup>6</sup>

A notable observation pertains to the cost escalation within the same project line. The extension of the Southern Expressway from Matara to Beliatta was awarded at a significantly higher cost of US$ 26 million per kilometer.<sup>4</sup> This represents a substantial 6-7 fold increase compared to the earlier Galle-Matara section.<sup>4</sup> While factors such as general inflation or specific terrain challenges might account for some increase, a jump of this magnitude within the same expressway system strongly suggests that elements beyond legitimate construction complexities were at play. This points towards a potential shift in procurement practices, a decline in oversight, or an escalation of less transparent practices over time, rather than solely inherent project difficulties.

#### 2.2. Katunayake Expressway (CKE)

The 26-kilometer Colombo-Katunayake Expressway (CKE) was reported to have cost US$ 350 million or Rs 45.7 billion.<sup>3</sup> This translates to a cost of US$ 14 million or Rs 1.8 billion per kilometer.<sup>3</sup> This figure was approximately double the cost per kilometer of the completed Kottawa to Pinnaduwa stretch of the Southern Expressway.<sup>3</sup> The project was initially estimated to cost US$ 292 million or Rs 38 billion.<sup>3</sup> Even before construction began, there were concerns that it would be the "most expensive highway in the world".<sup>7</sup> Upon its completion in November 2011, the costs had reportedly reached US$ 310 million (Rs. 35.6 billion), with total expenditures reaching Rs. 50.444 billion, marking an almost 10-fold increase from a 1991 estimate of US$ 110 million for a similar length.<sup>8</sup>

The CKE was primarily funded by a loan from China through the Exim Bank, with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) serving as a main contractor.<sup>3</sup> The consistent reporting that the CKE's cost per kilometer was "double" that of the Southern Expressway is a significant quantitative discrepancy. This observation is further amplified by direct public allegations from UNP MP Mangala Samaraweera, who charged that "someone in the regime made Rs. 1 billion per km" off the CKE.<sup>9</sup> He drew a comparison to a Chinese-aided highway in Kenya, which reportedly cost significantly less at Rs. 972 million per kilometer.<sup>9</sup> This moves beyond mere cost discrepancy to a direct allegation of illicit enrichment. The comparison to a similar Chinese-funded project in another developing country, at a much lower cost, strengthens the argument that the Sri Lankan costs were artificially inflated, suggesting a systemic issue rather than unique project challenges.

#### 2.3. Outer Circular Highway (OCH)

The Outer Circular Highway has been a subject of particular scrutiny due to its exceptionally high reported costs. Specifically, Phase 3, connecting Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya (a length of 9.2 km to 9.32 km), was awarded to China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) in January 2013 for Rs. 66.69 billion, financed by a loan from the Chinese Exim Bank.<sup>8</sup>

The cost per kilometer for this section was estimated at US$ 57 million <sup>10</sup>, with other reports citing figures as high as US$ 72 million per kilometer based on Road Development Authority (RDA) estimates for Phase 3.<sup>4</sup> This section has been described by experts as "the world's costliest suburban expressway, outside of Japan".<sup>4</sup> It is alleged to be overpriced by at least 68 percent.<sup>5</sup> Furthermore, a critical procedural bypass was reported: the agreement with the Chinese company was allegedly signed

_before_ cabinet approval.<sup>11</sup>

The characterization of OCH Phase 3 as "the world's costliest suburban expressway, outside of Japan" is a powerful qualitative indicator of extreme cost inflation. While Japan's high costs are often attributed to unique geological and urban challenges, these conditions are not fully replicated in Sri Lanka to justify such parity. The revelation that the contract was signed prior to cabinet approval suggests a severe lapse in governance and procurement protocols, potentially indicating a deliberate circumvention of checks and balances to facilitate an overpriced deal. This points to a deeply embedded systemic issue of bypassing standard procedures for specific projects, likely driven by political influence or other forms of financial impropriety.

#### 2.4. Central Expressway (CEP)

The Central Expressway Project (CEP) has also faced significant cost discrepancies. Section 1, the Kadawatha–Mirigama leg (37 km), was awarded directly to Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC) in 2015-16. Its reported cost per kilometer was around US$ 33 million.<sup>12</sup> Initial bids for this sector were 18-20% higher than the engineer's estimate but were subsequently negotiated down.<sup>8</sup> This project was intended to be funded by a US$ 989 million loan from China EXIM Bank (covering 85%) with the remaining 15% from local banks.<sup>12</sup> Significant delays have plagued this section, with only 36% completion as of November last year, despite approximately US$ 241 million being certified for payment for partially completed work. China EXIM Bank, however, had only disbursed US$ 51.5 million.<sup>12</sup> Reports also indicate that partially built structures, including a concrete beam, have collapsed.<sup>12</sup>

In contrast, Section 2 of the Central Expressway, connecting Mirigama to Kurunegala (39.29 km), was built by local companies for around US$ 18 million per kilometer.<sup>12</sup> This section was sub-divided into four packages and awarded to local contractors without competitive bidding, with initial bids negotiated down from Rs. 126.8 billion to Rs. 136.8 billion (approximately Rs. 3.49 billion per km).<sup>8</sup> The final cost for this section is expected to exceed Rs. 175 billion, or over Rs. 4.5 billion per kilometer.<sup>8</sup>

The stark contrast between the cost per kilometer for the Chinese-contracted Section 1 (US$$33M/km)andthelocally−contractedSection2(US$$18M/km) of the Central Expressway is a critical quantitative finding. This "foreign premium" suggests that contracts awarded to international firms, particularly Chinese entities, often without competitive bidding, carry significantly higher costs than those undertaken by local companies. This implies either a lack of cost-efficiency from foreign contractors or, more likely, the inclusion of "hidden costs" such as commissions or inflated margins, facilitated by non-transparent procurement processes. Such practices directly contribute to the national debt burden and represent a significant drain on public resources. The Lanka Infrastructure Development Consortium (LIDC) argued that local contractors could complete Section 1 for US$ 300 million less than the MCC contract, further underscoring this discrepancy.<sup>12</sup>

#### 2.5. Northern Expressway (NEP)

The Northern Expressway was proposed as a 300-kilometer highway, with an initial total estimated cost of US$ 4.5 billion.<sup>13</sup> Stage 1, from Enderamulla to Ambepussa, was alone expected to cost US$ 1 billion with Chinese assistance.<sup>13</sup> The proposed cost per kilometer was US$ 19 million.<sup>4</sup>

Political decisions significantly impacted the route and cost of this project. A directive from President Rajapaksa to change the Kandy Expressway route to Kurunegala and Galagedara, intended to avoid land acquisition problems, directly led to increased length and costs.<sup>8</sup> The amended route traversed flood plains and marshes, necessitating expensive viaducts (overhead roads) which cost over six times the cost of firm-ground roads.<sup>8</sup> This substantial increase in cost led to the withdrawal of an initial Chinese investor.<sup>8</sup> The estimate for the Enderamulla to Mirigama section consequently rose from Rs. 70 billion to Rs. 100 billion, eventually being awarded to MCC at Rs. 129 billion.<sup>8</sup>

The detailed account of how political decisions, such as accommodating protests by relocating the Northern Expressway route to marshy flood plains, directly led to massive cost escalations (e.g., viaducts costing six times more than firm ground roads) establishes a direct causal link between political expediency and inflated project costs.<sup>8</sup> This demonstrates that cost inflation is not solely due to corruption within the procurement process but also stems from politically motivated rerouting or design changes that disregard economic viability and engineering prudence. This highlights a systemic issue where political considerations override sound technical and financial planning, leading to significant public expenditure without commensurate value.

### 3. Benchmarking Sri Lanka's Road Construction Costs

This section compares Sri Lanka's per-kilometer road construction costs with international and regional averages, quantifying the magnitude of alleged overspending and critically analyzing factors that might legitimately influence costs.

#### 3.1. International and Regional Average Cost Ranges

A four-lane expressway in a range of developing countries typically costs between US$ 7-10 million per kilometer at current global prices.<sup>4</sup> This range serves as a fundamental baseline for comparison. Studies by the World Bank (covering over 430 road projects from 65 developing countries) and the University of Oxford (3,000 road construction projects in 99 developing countries) consistently found that even the 'high' averages of global expressway construction costs are "significantly lower" than those observed in Sri Lanka.<sup>4</sup>

Regional comparisons further highlight the discrepancies. India, for instance, is specifically noted for having one of the lowest expressway construction costs globally.<sup>4</sup> In stark contrast, Sri Lanka's costs for projects in 2013-2014 were reported to be double that of Vietnam, quadruple that of Pakistan, and generally five to ten times more expensive than India.<sup>4</sup> While high-end comparisons, such as Japanese expressways, can exceed US$ 200 million per kilometer due to unique and extreme conditions like mountainous terrain, high seismic activity, and exorbitant land acquisition costs, the Outer Circular Highway Phase 3's US$ 72 million per kilometer cost is explicitly compared to these, being noted as one of the world's costliest suburban expressways outside of Japan.<sup>4</sup>

#### 3.2. Comparative Analysis: Sri Lankan Costs vs. Benchmarks and Magnitude of Alleged Overspending

The analysis reveals a consistent pattern of elevated costs in Sri Lanka. Expressway projects such as the Katunayake Expressway at US$$15millionperkilometer,theOuterCircularHighway(OCH)atUS$$19-72 million per kilometer, and the proposed Northern Expressway at US$$19millionperkilometer,appeartobetwotothreetimeshigherthanthetypicalUS$$ 7-10 million per kilometer range for four-lane expressways in developing countries.<sup>4</sup>

In extreme cases, the OCH Phase 3, at US$ 72 million per kilometer, stands out as a severe outlier, potentially 7-10 times higher than the developing country average and significantly exceeding even the "high" global averages.<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, the extension of the Southern Expressway from Galle-Matara to Beliatta, costing US$ 26 million per kilometer, demonstrates a 6-7 times difference compared to the earlier Galle-Matara section.<sup>4</sup>

The consistent finding from multiple, independent studies (World Bank, Oxford) that Sri Lanka's road construction costs are "significantly lower" than even global _high_ averages, coupled with specific projects being 2-3 times, 6-7 times, or even 7-10 times higher than regional benchmarks, moves beyond mere inefficiency or justifiable cost variations.<sup>4</sup> The sheer magnitude of these disparities, particularly for projects like OCH Phase 3 being comparable to high-cost Japanese projects without similar justifying factors, strongly implies systemic issues such as corruption and rent-seeking rather than just poor management or legitimate construction challenges. This scale of overspending is economically irrational under normal market conditions and strongly points to a deliberate inflation of costs.

#### 3.3. Analysis of Justifying Factors and Their Sufficiency

The research acknowledges several factors that can legitimately increase construction costs. These include difficult terrain, challenging soil and climatic conditions, specific design standards, the type of construction, the number and complexity of structures (e.g., bridges, tunnels, viaducts), labor and material costs, and land acquisition expenses.<sup>4</sup> It is also noted that expressway construction in urban areas can be four to five times more expensive than in rural areas.<sup>4</sup>

Regarding inflation, the ICTAD road construction cost index in Sri Lanka doubled from 2004 to 2013. However, when adjusted for foreign exchange variation, the increase in USD reduces to just over 50%.<sup>4</sup> While this rate is higher than that observed in the USA (10%), Australia (20%), and most European Union countries (2-3%), India's index remained nearly constant during a similar period.<sup>4</sup>

Despite these acknowledged factors, the reported cost disparities are too large to be fully justified by legitimate reasons alone. Professor Kumarage explicitly states that such an escalation "cannot be explained by price inflation or design alone".<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, the analysis reveals critical instances where some "justifying factors" were themselves a consequence of questionable decisions. For example, the shift of certain expressway routes to difficult, marshy terrain (e.g., Northern Expressway) due to political decisions directly increased costs significantly, necessitating expensive viaducts.<sup>8</sup> This indicates that these challenges were not always unavoidable natural conditions but sometimes "manufactured" complexities arising from politically influenced route changes or project designs. This blurs the line between legitimate cost drivers and those that are a direct consequence of decisions that may have been influenced by corrupt motives or political expediency, further inflating costs and undermining the integrity of project planning.

### 4. Mechanisms of Cost Inflation and Corruption Allegations

The significant disparities in road construction costs in Sri Lanka are frequently attributed to a range of systemic irregularities and alleged corrupt practices. These mechanisms undermine transparent procurement, inflate project values, and divert public funds.

#### 4.1. Procurement Irregularities: Non-Competitive Bidding, Unsolicited Proposals, and Limited Bidding Processes

Corruption in the procurement stage is a pervasive concern within the Sri Lankan construction industry.<sup>14</sup> Common practices identified include payments for recommendation and approval of contracts, bid rigging, and falsification of procurement documents.<sup>14</sup>

The impact of non-competitive bidding is particularly severe. Projects awarded without competitive bidding were mathematically proven to be 55% costlier in 2011.<sup>4</sup> This alarming trend escalated, reaching a peak in 2014, when projects reportedly worth Rs. 333 billion were awarded without competitive bidding. In these specific cases, costs were found to be higher by approximately 135%, leading to estimated losses of Rs. 200.5 billion.<sup>4</sup> It is noteworthy that these highly overpriced projects were predominantly funded by Chinese sources and awarded to Chinese contractors.<sup>5</sup> A similar pattern has been observed with local contractors funded by local banks, where contracts worth Rs. 110 billion were awarded on a non-competitive basis in the same year.<sup>5</sup> This consistent correlation between the absence of competitive bidding and significantly inflated costs strongly suggests that the lack of open competition creates an environment conducive to rent-seeking and artificial price inflation.

Foreign investors often find it difficult to navigate Sri Lanka's opaque procurement process, especially for large infrastructure contracts or government tenders.<sup>1</sup> This opacity, combined with the prevalence of non-competitive awards, creates an uneven playing field and allows for the awarding of contracts to pre-selected firms at inflated prices.

#### 4.2. Contract Fragmentation

A prevalent mechanism for circumventing public tender regulations is the fragmentation of large projects into numerous smaller contracts, typically valued at less than Rs. 5 million. A striking example of this practice was uncovered in the North Central Provincial Council, where the rehabilitation of 53 flood-damaged roads in 2011 was divided into 741 projects, each valued under Rs. 5 million.<sup>15</sup> This fragmentation allowed these projects to be implemented with the approval of the then Director General of the Provincial Road Development Authority, bypassing competitive public tenders and enabling awards through limited bidding processes.<sup>15</sup>

Further investigation revealed that these projects were distributed among only seven contractors without a public tender process, with one contractor receiving 629 projects (covering 42 roads) worth Rs. 2,934 million.<sup>15</sup> This was despite officials stating that based on the contractor's financial capacity and experience, contracts worth only Rs. 300-600 million should have been awarded to them.<sup>15</sup> Payments of up to Rs. 45 million were made for one kilometer of road that would typically cost around Rs. 11 million, indicating severe corruption and massive overpayments.<sup>15</sup> This deliberate fragmentation serves as a clear tactic to evade oversight and facilitate illicit contract awards, leading to significant misuse of public funds.

#### 4.3. Subcontracting Practices: "Instant Profits"

Allegations of "instant profits" through immediate subcontracting of work at significantly lower rates than the original contract value are a recurring theme. Highways Minister Kabir Hashim revealed that some firms flipped deals to subcontractors at a 25-30% "instant profit".<sup>18</sup> In one specific case, a road contract between Kalugamuwa and Wilakatupotha, awarded for Rs. 2.1 billion (funded by local banks), was immediately given to a subcontractor for Rs. 1.6 billion, yielding a Rs. 500 million instant profit for the primary contractor without any work being carried out.<sup>18</sup> The subcontractor was also likely making a profit of Rs. 300-400 million.<sup>18</sup>

Chinese-funded road projects have been particularly implicated in these practices. Construction industry sources revealed that Chinese firms maximize profits by awarding subcontracts to local contractors at significantly lower costs, sometimes paying subcontractors only 40% of the estimated cost per kilometer.<sup>11</sup> This practice suggests that the initial contract prices awarded to the Chinese firms are excessively estimated, creating substantial room for profit through subcontracting. The difference between the estimated cost and the actual cost paid to subcontractors remains unaccounted for, raising questions about the destination of billions of rupees.<sup>11</sup> This mechanism indicates that inflated initial contract values are not merely a result of inefficiency but are likely designed to facilitate rent-seeking through immediate and substantial profit margins for the primary contractor.

#### 4.4. Political Interference and Influence

Reports consistently highlight the pervasive role of political pressure and influence in the awarding of contracts and project management. The contracting company involved in the fragmented North Central Provincial Council road projects was explicitly linked to a politician who held power in the province at the time.<sup>15</sup> Officials cited political interference and intimidation as reasons for irregularities.<sup>17</sup>

Furthermore, political decisions have directly impacted project costs by altering routes or designs, often disregarding economic and engineering prudence. As detailed with the Northern Expressway, President Rajapaksa's directive to change the route to avoid land acquisition problems led to the highway traversing flood plains and marshes, necessitating expensive viaducts that cost over six times more than roads on firm ground.<sup>8</sup> This politically motivated shift increased costs significantly and even caused an initial Chinese investor to withdraw their offer.<sup>8</sup> Such instances demonstrate that political expediency, rather than sound technical and financial planning, can drive project decisions, leading to substantial cost inflation and undermining the integrity of infrastructure development.

#### 4.5. Lack of Oversight and Accountability

Despite numerous irregularities, the effectiveness of oversight mechanisms and corrective measures in Sri Lanka remains a significant concern. The Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) and Auditor-General reports have indeed uncovered widespread irregularities. For example, COPA revealed the massive fraud in the North Central Provincial Council road projects, noting that payments of up to Rs. 45 million were made for one kilometer of road that should have cost around Rs. 11 million, and that the roads deteriorated quickly due to substandard construction.<sup>15</sup> COPA described this as one of the most corrupt events in the country's road development history and recommended identifying officials involved and recovering misappropriated funds.<sup>15</sup>

However, there is a systemic failure to hold involved officials or firms accountable. A research brief by Verité Research highlights critical gaps in Sri Lanka's public procurement framework regarding blacklisting.<sup>20</sup> Procurement guidelines do not legally allow for blacklisting contractors or suppliers involved in fraud and corruption, and there is a failure to maintain a comprehensive blacklist for defaulting contractors.<sup>20</sup> This contrasts unfavorably with other South Asian countries that have more effective blacklisting implementations and updated online databases of blacklisted firms.<sup>20</sup> This lack of robust blacklisting provisions and enforcement means that companies found to be negligent or corrupt often face no lasting consequences, allowing them to continue participating in public projects.<sup>21</sup> The absence of appropriate consequences perpetuates a cycle of corruption, as there is little deterrent for firms or officials to engage in fraudulent practices.

### 5. Economic and Social Impact

The inflated costs associated with road construction projects in Sri Lanka have far-reaching and detrimental economic and social implications, contributing significantly to the nation's current financial distress and eroding public trust.

#### 5.1. Contribution to National Debt

The overspending on infrastructure projects, particularly those with inflated costs due to non-competitive bidding and other irregularities, has directly contributed to Sri Lanka's escalating national debt. China has emerged as the largest project lender, and many observers believe Sri Lanka will have difficulty repaying these loans.<sup>1</sup> The country's debt was considered unsustainable as early as 2020, leading to a sovereign debt default in 2022.<sup>22</sup>

Corrupt officials greenlighting "mega-projects not because they're needed, but because they're lucrative—for themselves" often fund these ventures through opaque, high-interest commercial loans like International Sovereign Bonds (ISBs).<sup>24</sup> These loans bypass the safeguards of multilateral lenders, leading to a cycle where more is borrowed to cover old loans, ultimately resulting in default.<sup>24</sup> By 2021, 36% of Sri Lanka's external debt was in ISBs, which consumed 70% of interest payments.<sup>24</sup> The IMF has warned that debt is at its highest in decades, with many low-income nations, including Sri Lanka, at significant risk.<sup>2</sup> The 2022 economic crisis, triggered in part by unsustainable debt and depleted reserves, was exacerbated by macroeconomic mismanagement and long-standing structural weaknesses, including those related to infrastructure spending.<sup>22</sup>

#### 5.2. Opportunity Costs

The vast sums diverted to inflated road construction costs represent significant opportunity costs for other critical sectors. Funds that could have been invested in healthcare, education, or other social welfare programs are instead tied up in overpriced infrastructure. For instance, the Auditor-General flagged Rs. 100 billion in irregularities in 2021 alone, an amount exceeding the entire Samurdhi welfare budget.<sup>24</sup> This diversion means "overpriced medicines. Underfunded schools. Roads to nowhere" for the average citizen.<sup>24</sup>

Sri Lanka's publicly funded healthcare and education systems, which historically provided universal access, have faced severe consequences from the economic crisis.<sup>25</sup> The financial collapse exacerbated shortages of essential medical drugs and equipment, disrupting services.<sup>25</sup> Medical students, for example, faced significant impacts on their well-being and education due to the crisis.<sup>25</sup> The IMF highlights that education and health are key areas of spending for increasing population productivity, and the diversion of funds from these sectors due to inflated infrastructure costs represents a "huge opportunity cost".<sup>23</sup>

#### 5.3. Sustainability of the Infrastructure

Despite the massive expenditures, there are concerns about the long-term sustainability and quality of the constructed infrastructure. The North Central Provincial Council road projects, for example, were found to have lacked proper standards and deteriorated quickly, despite payments of up to Rs. 45 million per kilometer for roads that should have cost Rs. 11 million.<sup>15</sup> This indicates that inflated costs do not necessarily translate into higher quality or durable infrastructure. Partially built structures on the Central Expressway Section 1 have also collapsed, raising questions about construction integrity.<sup>12</sup> When corruption dictates who gets contracts, competence is often sidelined, and the nation ultimately pays the price through substandard infrastructure that requires early repairs or rehabilitation, further straining public finances.

#### 5.4. Public Trust in Governance and Development Initiatives

Corruption deeply erodes public trust in governance and development initiatives. It is perceived as a "hidden tax on progress" that quietly hollows out institutions, budgets, and public hopes.<sup>24</sup> Surveys show that honest companies in corrupt environments can lose up to 20% of revenue to "facilitation" fees.<sup>24</sup>

The 2022 economic crisis, triggered in part by fiscal mismanagement and corruption scandals, laid bare the scale of systemic rot, leading to mass protests (the "Aragalaya" movement) and a profound loss of faith in the state.<sup>24</sup> The public's rallying cry was a demand to "Stop the corruption," highlighting that graft had become a daily reality undermining livelihoods, infrastructure, and the rule of law.<sup>24</sup> When citizens observe massive overspending, substandard projects, and a lack of accountability, their belief in the ballot, the law, and the fairness of the system diminishes. This erosion of trust makes it harder for governments to implement necessary reforms and secure public cooperation for future development efforts.

### 6. Concluding Analysis

The comprehensive analysis of road construction costs in Sri Lanka following the civil war reveals a pervasive pattern of inflated expenditures, particularly for expressway projects undertaken post-2009. Projects like the Katunayake Expressway and the Outer Circular Highway Phase 3 exhibit costs per kilometer that are several times higher than international and regional benchmarks, often reaching levels comparable to the world's most expensive projects despite lacking similar justifying complexities. While factors such as difficult terrain, urban settings, and inflation can legitimately increase costs, the magnitude of the observed disparities cannot be fully explained by these alone. In several instances, "justifying factors" such as challenging terrain were themselves a consequence of politically motivated route changes, further inflating costs.

The primary drivers behind these inflated costs are deeply rooted in systemic irregularities. Non-competitive bidding processes, particularly for projects funded by Chinese loans and awarded to Chinese contractors, consistently resulted in significantly higher costs (55% to 135% more expensive). The deliberate fragmentation of large projects into smaller contracts, designed to circumvent public tender regulations, enabled illicit awards and led to massive overpayments, as exemplified by the North Central Provincial Council road rehabilitation. Furthermore, allegations of "instant profits" through immediate subcontracting at vastly lower rates point to inflated initial contract values and rent-seeking. Political interference, influencing both contract awards and project design, has demonstrably overridden sound economic and engineering principles, leading to economically irrational and costly decisions.

The consequences of these inflated costs are severe and have contributed significantly to Sri Lanka's economic crisis. The increased national debt, exacerbated by opaque, high-interest commercial loans, has led to a sovereign default and diverted critical funds. This has resulted in substantial opportunity costs, with essential sectors like healthcare and education facing underfunding. The sustainability of the infrastructure itself is questionable, with reports of substandard construction and rapid deterioration despite exorbitant expenditures. Crucially, these financial irregularities have profoundly eroded public trust in governance and development initiatives, culminating in widespread protests and a demand for accountability.

Sri Lanka faces significant challenges in ensuring transparency and accountability in future infrastructure projects. The existing public procurement framework suffers from critical gaps, notably the lack of robust legal provisions for blacklisting contractors involved in fraud and corruption, and a failure to maintain a comprehensive blacklist. Oversight bodies like COPA and the Auditor-General's department have uncovered irregularities, but the absence of effective corrective measures and appropriate consequences for involved officials and firms allows corrupt practices to persist. Addressing these challenges requires fundamental reforms: strengthening procurement laws to mandate competitive bidding for all major projects, implementing rigorous blacklisting mechanisms, enhancing the independence and capacity of oversight institutions, and fostering a political environment where decisions prioritize national economic viability over personal or political gain. Without such systemic changes, the cycle of inflated costs and eroded public trust is likely to continue, hindering Sri Lanka's long-term development aspirations.
