## Sri Lanka vs. Singapore: A Critical Analysis of Government Expenditure as a Percentage of GDP

### Executive Summary

This report provides a critical analysis of government expenditure as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Sri Lanka and Singapore, examining their distinct fiscal landscapes, expenditure compositions, and policy approaches. A central finding is the significant methodological differences in reported data, which are paramount for accurate comparison. While headline figures for total government expenditure as a percentage of GDP might appear numerically similar under certain definitions, a deeper examination reveals fundamentally divergent fiscal paths. Sri Lanka's expenditure is heavily burdened by debt servicing and recurrent costs, exacerbated by recent economic crises and governance challenges, which severely limit its capacity for productive investment and social welfare. In stark contrast, Singapore demonstrates a highly prudent and strategic fiscal model, leveraging substantial national reserves to fund long-term development, human capital, and robust public services, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with no net debt. The analysis underscores that the _quality_ and _composition_ of government spending, underpinned by robust governance and sustainable revenue generation, are more critical indicators of fiscal health and economic development than the mere percentage of GDP spent.

### 1. Introduction: Fiscal Landscapes of Sri Lanka and Singapore

This report aims to provide a critical examination of government expenditure in two distinct Asian economies: Sri Lanka and Singapore. The objective extends beyond a superficial numerical comparison to delve into the underlying fiscal philosophies, prevailing economic contexts, and the policy implications that shape public spending in each nation. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for comprehending their respective economic trajectories and the challenges or advantages they face.

Government expenditure as a percentage of GDP serves as a key indicator of the state's role and influence within an economy. This metric reflects a government's fiscal priorities and its capacity to provide essential public goods and services, ranging from infrastructure and education to healthcare and social safety nets. While a higher percentage might suggest a greater degree of state intervention or a larger public sector, its effectiveness is not solely determined by its size. Rather, the ultimate impact hinges on the quality, composition, and productivity of that spending. An analysis of this metric, therefore, must consider not just the numbers, but also the underlying economic realities and policy choices that drive them.

### 2. Defining and Measuring Government Expenditure and GDP

Accurately comparing government expenditure between countries necessitates a clear understanding of the methodologies used to define and measure both GDP and government spending. International bodies like the IMF and World Bank provide frameworks, but variations in their application and scope can lead to significant discrepancies in reported figures.

#### Standard Methodologies (IMF GFS, World Bank, SNA 2008)

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is universally recognized as a comprehensive measure of a country's economic activity. It represents the final market value of all goods and services produced within a nation's borders over a specific period, typically a year. GDP can be calculated through various approaches, including the expenditure approach (summing consumer spending, government spending, investments, and net exports), the production approach, or the income approach.<sup>1</sup> To provide a more accurate reflection of economic growth, removing the effects of inflation, real GDP is often calculated using a GDP price deflator.<sup>1</sup>

The definition of "government expenditure" can vary, leading to notable differences in reported percentages. The World Bank's "General government final consumption expenditure" is a narrower definition. It includes all government current expenditures for purchases of goods and services, including compensation of employees, and most expenditures on national defense and security. However, it explicitly _excludes_ government military expenditures that are part of government capital formation.<sup>3</sup> This definition is frequently used by data aggregators like TheGlobalEconomy.com. In contrast, the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) Government Finance Statistics (GFS) framework, particularly the GFSM 2014, offers a more comprehensive view. It aims to capture "all transactions that decrease net worth," encompassing a broader range of government outlays, such as capital formation and various transfers, thereby providing a more holistic picture of overall fiscal activity.<sup>7</sup>

#### Clarifying Data Definitions and Potential Discrepancies

Sri Lanka's official national accounts estimates are compiled by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), which adheres to the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008) guidelines, with 2015 as the current base year.<sup>11</sup> The Ministry of Finance's Department of State Accounts is actively migrating its GFS compilation from the older GFSM 1986 to the more recent GFSM 2014, signaling a move towards enhanced international best practices in fiscal reporting.<sup>12</sup> Sri Lanka's public sector GFS covers a broad range of entities, including the Budgetary Central Government, Extrabudgetary Entities, Provincial Councils, Local Authorities, and Public Corporations.<sup>12</sup>

For Singapore, the Department of Statistics (SingStat) compiles GDP estimates using the expenditure, output, and income approaches, following the recommendations of the UN SNA 2008 framework.<sup>2</sup> The Ministry of Finance (MOF) also publishes government finance data that align with the IMF's GFS presentation format.<sup>13</sup>

A significant difference in reported government expenditure percentages for Singapore highlights the importance of definitional clarity. TheGlobalEconomy.com, citing the World Bank, reports Singapore's government spending as 10.23% of GDP for 2023.<sup>3</sup> Conversely, CEIC, citing the IMF, reports Singapore's General Government Expenditure as 20.072% of GDP for 2023.<sup>14</sup> This substantial variation stems from the World Bank's narrower "final consumption expenditure" definition, which excludes capital formation, versus the IMF's broader "general government expenditure" that includes a wider array of government outlays. For a more meaningful and comprehensive comparative analysis of total government outlays and their economic impact, the broader IMF-consistent figure is more appropriate.

The disparity in reported figures for Singapore's government expenditure underscores a critical challenge in cross-country comparisons: the "apples to oranges" problem. When the user's query asks for a critical analysis "against the calculation like Singapore's," it becomes immediately apparent that the choice of definition for "government expenditure" is not a mere technicality but a fundamental analytical decision. The World Bank's definition, by explicitly excluding capital formation, presents a picture of government size that omits a significant portion of public investment, which is crucial for long-term economic development. The IMF's GFS framework, in contrast, provides a more comprehensive capture of all government transactions that decrease net worth, including these vital investments. Therefore, to conduct a truly critical analysis that reflects the full scope of government's fiscal activities and their burden or benefit to the economy, utilizing the broader IMF GFS definition is essential. This initial methodological clarification is paramount to ensure the integrity and validity of any subsequent quantitative comparisons and qualitative assessments.

Furthermore, the commitment to adopting international statistical standards, such as GFSM 2014 and SNA 2008, is more than a technical exercise; it serves as a strong indicator of a nation's dedication to fiscal transparency and sound governance. Sri Lanka's ongoing efforts to migrate to GFSM 2014 represent a positive step towards improving its fiscal reporting. However, past issues noted by the IMF, such as the "inadvertent provision of inaccurate data" and "under-reporting of arrears stock" <sup>15</sup>, highlight systemic weaknesses that can undermine investor confidence and the overall effectiveness of policy. Singapore's established adherence to these advanced statistical frameworks implies a higher degree of data reliability and comprehensiveness. This difference in data quality and reporting maturity is itself a critical aspect of a nation's fiscal health and governance, influencing how external actors perceive and interact with each economy. Reliable and transparent data are foundational for informed policy-making and fostering trust among domestic and international stakeholders.

### 3. Sri Lanka's Government Expenditure: Trends, Composition, and Fiscal Challenges

Sri Lanka's government expenditure has been a central feature of its recent economic challenges. In 2022, government expenditure stood at 18.59% of GDP, while government revenue was significantly lower at 8.36% of GDP, according to IMF data.<sup>16</sup> This substantial gap between spending and revenue has been a persistent issue. For 2025, Sri Lanka projects a total expenditure of 21.8% of GDP, which is expected to result in a considerable budget deficit of 6.7% of GDP.<sup>17</sup> This projected deficit was subsequently revised down slightly to 6.5% of GDP.<sup>18</sup> The government's medium-term fiscal objectives for the 2021-2025 period include ambitious targets such as containing the fiscal deficit to 4.0% of GDP and reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to approximately 75.5% by 2025.<sup>19</sup>

#### Breakdown of Expenditure Categories (Recurrent, Public Investment, Debt Servicing)

A closer examination of Sri Lanka's expenditure composition reveals a significant structural imbalance. In 2022, government primary expenditure, which excludes interest payments, was 12.08% of GDP. However, interest paid on public debt consumed a substantial 6.5% of GDP in the same year.<sup>16</sup> This highlights the heavy burden of debt servicing on the national budget.

For 2025, total expenditure is projected at Rs. 7,190 billion.<sup>17</sup> Recurrent expenditure is projected at Rs. 5,886 billion for 2025.<sup>17</sup> The government aims to reduce this category from 14.2% of GDP in 2021 to at least 12.3% of GDP by 2025.<sup>19</sup> Key components of recurrent expenditure include salaries and wages (Rs. 1,230 billion) and interest payments (Rs. 2,950 billion).<sup>17</sup> The overwhelming proportion of the budget allocated to interest payments is a critical factor limiting the government's fiscal flexibility. Subsidies and transfers, providing financial support to low-income groups and businesses, are projected at Rs. 1,290 billion.<sup>17</sup>

Public investment, or capital expenditure, is projected at Rs. 1,315 billion for 2025.<sup>17</sup> The fiscal strategy aims to maintain public investments at an average of over 5.0-6.0% of GDP per annum during 2021-2025 to facilitate high and sustained economic growth.<sup>19</sup> Capital expenditure and net lending are projected to increase from 2.6% of GDP in 2024 to 4.0% in 2027 and 4.3% by 2030, reflecting a focus on infrastructure development and long-term investments.<sup>18</sup> However, historical data indicates that actual capital expenditure has often fallen short of budgeted amounts, with only 65% utilized in the past year.<sup>18</sup>

#### Fiscal Policy Objectives, Revenue Mobilization, and Debt Management Strategies

Sri Lanka's fiscal policy objectives center on achieving macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. Key targets include increasing the revenue-to-GDP ratio to over 14% by 2025, rationalizing unproductive expenditure, and achieving a primary surplus.<sup>19</sup> In an effort to reverse the declining revenue trend (which fell to less than 8% of GDP in 2022 <sup>21</sup>), the government introduced several revenue enhancement measures in 2022. These included a retrospective one-off surcharge tax, an increased VAT rate on financial services, and the simplification of various tax instruments by combining or removing certain taxes like the Port and Airport Levy (PAL), Nation Building Tax (NBT), Pay As You Earn (PAYE), and Withholding Tax (WHT).<sup>19</sup> Efforts to strengthen revenue administration include establishing a Large Tax Payers Unit (LTU), introducing risk-based audits, and improving the Revenue Administration Management Information System (RAMIS).<sup>19</sup> The Sri Lanka Customs is also implementing a "Single Window System" to streamline trade processes.<sup>19</sup>

Expenditure rationalization measures have been introduced, such as freezing expenditure on vehicle and building purchases and digitalizing key government processes like e-procurement and the e-National ID Card.<sup>19</sup> Restrictions were also placed on unproductive or non-essential recurrent expenditures, including overtime payments and new recruitments.<sup>22</sup>

Sri Lanka faced its most severe economic crisis in 2022-23, marked by a sovereign debt default due to plummeting foreign currency reserves and unsustainable debt levels.<sup>23</sup> The country has since secured a debt restructuring deal of US

$$17.5billionwithprivatebondholdersandChina,coupledwithsignificantfinancialassistancefromtheIMF(US$$3 billion) and India (US$4 billion).<sup>15</sup> The government's current strategy is heavily focused on debt reduction and achieving fiscal sustainability.<sup>18</sup>

#### Impact on Public Services (Healthcare, Education, Social Welfare) and Infrastructure

The 2022 economic crisis severely disrupted public services in Sri Lanka, leading to critical shortages of essential medical drugs and equipment.<sup>26</sup> This occurred despite the country's historical commitment to state-paid healthcare and education systems, which have traditionally provided universal access.<sup>26</sup> Government expenditure on education was 8.68% of total government expenditure in 2023 <sup>27</sup>, translating to approximately 5.346% of GDP.<sup>28</sup> Healthcare spending per capita saw a decline, reaching $145.56 in 2022.<sup>29</sup>

Compared to other regions in South Asia, Sri Lanka spends less on health, education, and social protection as a percentage of GDP, often falling below recommended international expenditure benchmarks.<sup>30</sup> Analysis of social protection programs indicates that while social assistance spending is around 0.63% of GDP, social insurance (primarily public pensions) accounts for a larger 1.97% of GDP, despite having fewer beneficiaries. This raises concerns about the equity of social protection allocation.<sup>31</sup> Public investment is directed towards infrastructure development, including roads and water access.<sup>19</sup> However, past capital expenditures have been criticized for not being deployed in priority areas and yielding low long-term returns, indicating inefficiencies in investment.<sup>18</sup>

A significant observation from Sri Lanka's fiscal trajectory is the emergence of a vicious cycle driven by its substantial debt burden and the resulting fiscal constraints. The large share of the budget consumed by interest payments (6.5% of GDP in 2022; Rs. 2,950 billion in 2025) represents a critical opportunity cost. Funds diverted to debt servicing cannot be channeled into productive investments in essential infrastructure or human capital, which are vital for long-term economic growth. Furthermore, historical data indicating inefficient deployment or under-spending of even the limited capital expenditure means that the investments made were not yielding optimal returns. This perpetuates a cycle where the inability to make productive investments hinders economic growth, making it increasingly difficult to generate the necessary revenue to service existing debt, thereby intensifying the debt burden. Sri Lanka's fiscal challenges are thus not merely a matter of insufficient revenue; they are fundamentally rooted in the structure of its expenditure and the overwhelming weight of legacy debt. This necessitates not only aggressive fiscal consolidation and debt restructuring but also a fundamental re-evaluation of spending priorities to ensure that every rupee spent contributes effectively to sustainable development and poverty reduction.

The economic crisis has also precipitated a profound and long-term economic and social cost in the form of a "brain drain." Over 300,000 skilled professionals left Sri Lanka for foreign employment in 2024 alone.<sup>23</sup> This exodus includes critical medical experts, directly impacting the quality of medical education and healthcare delivery within the country.<sup>26</sup> This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the prevailing economic instability and the scarcity of opportunities at home. The depletion of the nation's human capital through this outflow reduces the potential tax base and weakens institutional capacity, making it even more challenging for the government to implement effective reforms and deliver quality public services.<sup>23</sup> This highlights a critical, non-fiscal challenge that has deep roots in fiscal instability and requires comprehensive policy responses that extend beyond mere budgetary adjustments.

Underlying many of Sri Lanka's fiscal challenges are systemic and severe corruption vulnerabilities and governance weaknesses. These issues have directly contributed to economic inefficiencies in areas such as tax collection, public investment, and credit allocation.<sup>21</sup> The IMF's governance diagnostic report and documented issues with "inaccurate data" <sup>15</sup> further underscore these deep-seated structural problems. The effectiveness of government expenditure is not solely determined by its volume or even its stated priorities; it is profoundly impacted by the quality of governance. In Sri Lanka's context, weak governance undermines both the ability to mobilize sufficient revenue (through inefficient tax collection) and to spend effectively (through poor returns on public investment). This implies that even with increased revenue or substantial international aid, the desired economic and social outcomes may not materialize without addressing these fundamental governance issues. Therefore, sustainable fiscal reforms must be deeply integrated with broader anti-corruption and institutional strengthening initiatives to ensure that public resources are used effectively and for the collective good.

### 4. Singapore's Government Expenditure: Trends, Composition, and Fiscal Strengths

Singapore's government expenditure patterns present a distinct picture, characterized by strategic allocation and prudent financial management. When using the World Bank's "General government final consumption expenditure" definition, Singapore's government spending was 10.23% of GDP in 2023, an increase from 9.45% in 2022. This figure is notably below the world average of 16.14%.<sup>3</sup> However, when employing the broader IMF GFS definition of "General Government Expenditure," Singapore's figure was 20.072% of GDP in 2023, up from 19.929% in 2022.<sup>14</sup> The average from 1990-2023 under this more comprehensive definition is 17.649%.<sup>14</sup> Looking ahead, government expenditure is projected to increase to approximately 19%-20% of GDP in Fiscal Year (FY) 2026–2030, potentially exceeding 20% by FY2030, largely driven by rising healthcare expenditure.<sup>33</sup>

#### Breakdown of Expenditure Categories (Operating, Development, Social Development, Defence)

For Fiscal Year 2025 (FY2025), Singapore's total expenditure is estimated at S$$123.79billion.[34,35]Thisisbroadlycategorizedintooperatinganddevelopmentexpenditures.OperatingexpenditureisprojectedatS$$97.03 billion for FY2025, representing an 8.3% increase from FY2024.<sup>13</sup> This category encompasses manpower costs, grants, subventions, and transfers.<sup>13</sup> Development expenditure is projected at S$26.76 billion for FY2025, a 14.6% increase from FY2024.<sup>13</sup> Singapore consistently allocates a significant portion, around 20%, of its budget to development and investment, a trend that contrasts with many advanced economies.<sup>36</sup>

The sectoral allocation of operating expenditure for FY2023/24 reveals clear priorities:

* Social Development: This broad category accounted for 57% of operating expenditure, aimed at improving citizens' lives. It encompasses social welfare, health, education, environmental sustainability, culture, digital industries' development, and land/infrastructure management.<sup>37</sup>
* Security & External Relations (Defence, Home Affairs, Foreign Affairs): 31.1%.<sup>37</sup>
* Growing the Economy: 8.1%.<sup>37</sup>
* Government Administration: 3.9%.<sup>37</sup>

Specific spending areas reflect these priorities. Healthcare expenditure is expected to rise significantly, from S$$21billionin2025tooverS$$30 billion by 2030.<sup>39</sup> In 2025, S

$$20.9billion(US$$15.6 billion) is allocated for health, making it the second-largest budget item after defense (S$$23.4billion).[40]Thesefundsaredirectedtowardsbuildingnewfacilities(hospitals,nursinghomes),manpower,andprovidingpatientsubsidies.[40]Foreducation,theMinistryofEducation′sprojectedexpenditureforFY2023wasS$$10.89 billion, allocated for student subsidies, educator salaries, manpower training, and technical education.<sup>41</sup> Education spending was 10.07% of total government expenditure in 2022.<sup>28</sup> In social and family development, the projected total expenditure for FY2023 was S$3.1 billion, with a significant portion allocated to family development programs and early childhood development.<sup>41</sup>

#### Fiscal Policy Goals, Revenue Sources, and Prudent Financial Management

Singapore's fiscal policies are designed to achieve macroeconomic stability, support economic growth, and promote social equity.<sup>36</sup> This is pursued through a disciplined approach of maintaining a balanced budget, investing for the future, and ensuring a fair and progressive fiscal system.<sup>37</sup>

The primary sources of government operating revenue include tax revenue, which accounted for 77.6% in FY2023/24, along with fees and charges, and other receipts.<sup>37</sup> Key taxes contributing to this revenue stream include Income Tax, Goods & Services Tax (GST), Property Tax, and Stamp Duty, among various other levies.<sup>37</sup> A unique and substantial revenue source is the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC), which contributes approximately 20% to Singapore's annual budget.<sup>36</sup> This significant contribution is derived from the returns generated on investments of Singapore's considerable national reserves.<sup>36</sup>

Singapore's commitment to prudent financial management is evident in its strong balance sheet, where assets consistently exceed liabilities, effectively resulting in "no net debt".<sup>42</sup> The government's approach to debt issuance is highly strategic; it does not borrow for recurrent spending needs but issues debt for specific, long-term objectives such as facilitating debt market development and financing nationally significant infrastructure projects.<sup>42</sup> A robust constitutional framework further protects past reserves, ensuring fiscal prudence and promoting intergenerational equity.<sup>13</sup>

#### Impact on Public Services (Healthcare, Education, Social Welfare) and Infrastructure

Public spending in Singapore is strategically focused on public goods and infrastructure, with substantial investments in skills, education, and infrastructure to foster long-term economic growth.<sup>36</sup> Social spending has more than doubled over the last decade, now constituting about half of total Ministry expenditure, reflecting a strong commitment to strengthening social safety nets.<sup>36</sup>

Healthcare subsidies are being increased, and greater flexibility is being provided for the use of MediSave funds for outpatient treatments. Healthcare capacity is also expanding significantly, with planned increases in nursing home and hospital beds by 2030 to meet rising demand.<sup>39</sup> The government ensures that basic healthcare, education, and housing are accessible to all segments of society.<sup>38</sup> The overall tax and transfer system is designed to be fair and progressive, ensuring that those who are better off contribute more, and the vulnerable benefit more from state spending.<sup>44</sup> This comprehensive approach to public services aims to enhance the overall quality of life and promote social mobility.

A defining characteristic of Singapore's fiscal approach, often referred to as the "Singapore Model," is its strategic investment through reserve management. While the narrower definition of government expenditure (World Bank) might suggest a lean government (around 10% of GDP), the broader IMF GFS figures (around 20% of GDP), combined with detailed expenditure breakdowns, clearly indicate substantial public spending, particularly in social development and infrastructure.<sup>37</sup> The crucial differentiator lies in how this spending is financed: a significant portion comes from the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) generated by Singapore's substantial national reserves.<sup>36</sup> This unique mechanism allows the government to fund extensive public services and long-term investments without imposing a heavy current tax burden on its citizens or accumulating net debt.<sup>42</sup> This approach provides significant fiscal flexibility and resilience, insulating the economy from short-term revenue fluctuations and enabling sustained investment in human capital and productive assets, which in turn reinforces long-term economic competitiveness.

Singapore's fiscal policy is also characterized by foresight and proactive planning, particularly in anticipating future demographic shifts and economic needs. The projected increase in government expenditure to over 20% of GDP by 2030 is explicitly driven by the rising healthcare costs associated with an aging population.<sup>33</sup> In response, the government is proactively expanding healthcare capacity and increasing subsidies.<sup>39</sup> Similarly, continuous and significant investments are made in education and research and development to drive future economic growth and maintain a competitive edge.<sup>36</sup> This proactive approach to allocating resources, particularly towards human capital development and essential services like healthcare, aims to mitigate future social and economic challenges before they escalate into crises. This contrasts sharply with reactive fiscal management, highlighting the benefits of a robust medium-term fiscal framework that aligns spending with anticipated societal needs and strategic economic goals.

The unwavering commitment to fiscal discipline serves as a fundamental pillar of Singapore's national resilience and global trustworthiness. The nation's "no net debt" position and its attainment of the top AAA credit rating from major international agencies are direct outcomes of its stringent fiscal prudence and the constitutional safeguards placed on its reserves.<sup>42</sup> Debt is issued only for specific, long-term, and productive purposes, such as developing the debt market or financing nationally significant infrastructure, rather than to cover recurrent spending.<sup>42</sup> This robust fiscal foundation provides Singapore with immense economic stability and resilience. It significantly reduces vulnerability to external financial shocks, lowers the cost of any necessary borrowing, and enhances its credibility as a reliable international financial center.<sup>33</sup> This strong fiscal position allows Singapore to maintain relatively low taxes while still funding high-quality public services and making strategic investments, creating a virtuous cycle of confidence and growth that is difficult for other nations to replicate without similar long-term discipline.

### 5. Critical Comparative Analysis: Divergent Fiscal Paths

A critical comparative analysis of government expenditure in Sri Lanka and Singapore reveals fundamentally divergent fiscal paths, despite some superficial numerical similarities. The examination highlights that while the percentage of GDP allocated to government spending can appear comparable under specific definitions, the underlying fiscal health, expenditure effectiveness, and national economic philosophies differ profoundly.

#### Quantitative Comparison of Expenditure Levels and Trends

When employing the broader "General Government Expenditure" definition, which is consistent with IMF GFS standards and provides a more comprehensive view of total government outlays, both Sri Lanka and Singapore show similar headline percentages. Sri Lanka's government expenditure was approximately 18.59% of GDP in 2022 <sup>16</sup>, with a projected 21.8% for 2025.<sup>17</sup> Singapore's General Government Expenditure was approximately 20.07% of GDP in 2023 <sup>14</sup>, with projections of 19-20% for FY2026-2030.<sup>33</sup> However, it is crucial to reiterate that the World Bank's "General government final consumption expenditure" presents Singapore's figure at a much lower 10.23% <sup>3</sup>, underscoring the critical importance of definitional consistency in any comparative analysis.

A stark contrast emerges when examining the relationship between revenue and expenditure. Sri Lanka consistently faces a significant gap, with government revenue at 8.36% of GDP in 2022 <sup>16</sup>, leading to substantial budget deficits (projected at 6.5% of GDP for 2025 <sup>18</sup>). This persistent imbalance necessitates borrowing and has contributed to its debt crisis. Singapore, conversely, consistently maintains a balanced budget within its term. Its operating revenue, augmented by the substantial Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC), typically covers total expenditure, resulting in consistent budget surpluses (S$2.74 billion projected for FY2025 <sup>34</sup>).

#### Qualitative Comparison of Expenditure Priorities and Efficiency

The qualitative dimensions of expenditure reveal the fundamental differences in fiscal management. In Sri Lanka, a disproportionately high percentage of expenditure is consumed by recurrent costs, particularly crippling interest payments, which stood at 6.5% of GDP in 2022.<sup>16</sup> This substantial allocation to debt servicing severely crowds out productive investment. While public investment is targeted for growth, it has historically suffered from under-spending and inefficient allocation, with past capital expenditures not always deployed in priority areas or yielding low long-term returns.<sup>18</sup> Social spending is comparatively low, and there are noted equity concerns in the allocation of social protection programs.<sup>31</sup>

Singapore, on the other hand, demonstrates a strategic allocation of resources. A significant portion of its operating expenditure (57%) is dedicated to "Social Development" <sup>37</sup>, encompassing long-term investments in healthcare, education, and social welfare. A consistent and substantial share of the budget, around 20%, is allocated to development expenditure for infrastructure and future growth.<sup>36</sup> The emphasis in Singapore is on achieving strong outcomes and delivering value for money for taxpayers, while maintaining a "light fiscal burden".<sup>36</sup>

The quantitative comparison, particularly when using the broader IMF GFS definition, initially suggests that both Sri Lanka and Singapore allocate a similar percentage of their GDP (around 20%) to government expenditure. However, this superficial numerical similarity masks a profound qualitative divergence. Sri Lanka's spending is heavily consumed by unproductive recurrent costs, most notably the substantial interest payments on its accumulated debt.<sup>16</sup> This structural burden is compounded by challenges in efficient capital allocation, where even limited investments have not consistently yielded optimal returns.<sup>18</sup> In stark contrast, Singapore strategically directs its spending towards long-term development, robust human capital (through significant investments in education and healthcare), and comprehensive social welfare programs.<sup>36</sup> This difference reveals that the "size" of government expenditure as a percentage of GDP is a misleading metric if not accompanied by a detailed analysis of its

_composition_ and _efficiency_. A high percentage of spending does not automatically translate to positive economic or social outcomes if it is burdened by debt servicing, unproductive outlays, or inefficient allocation. Singapore demonstrates that strategic, high-quality expenditure, even at a comparable percentage of GDP, can be a powerful engine for sustainable growth and social well-being. This highlights that _what_ a government spends on and _how effectively_ it spends it are far more critical indicators than the mere numerical proportion.

#### Contrasting Fiscal Frameworks and Debt Philosophies

Sri Lanka operates within a reactive fiscal framework, primarily focused on crisis management, revenue enhancement, and expenditure rationalization to address severe deficits and a recent sovereign debt default.<sup>22</sup> Its substantial debt burden is a major constraint, necessitating ongoing international assistance and complex debt restructuring efforts.<sup>23</sup>

Singapore adheres to a proactive and highly prudent fiscal policy, characterized by a strong balance sheet with effectively "no net debt".<sup>42</sup> Its unique NIRC mechanism allows it to fund significant public spending from the investment returns generated by its considerable national reserves.<sup>36</sup> Debt issuance in Singapore is strategic, solely for market development and financing nationally significant, long-term infrastructure projects, not for covering recurrent spending.<sup>42</sup> Constitutional safeguards further reinforce this fiscal prudence, protecting past reserves and ensuring intergenerational equity.<sup>13</sup>

Singapore's unique fiscal model, characterized by its "no net debt" position <sup>42</sup> and substantial revenue derived from its Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) on national reserves <sup>36</sup>, provides it with significant fiscal space. This financial buffer proved critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing Singapore to draw on its reserves to mitigate the economic impact without incurring new debt.<sup>36</sup> In stark contrast, Sri Lanka's severe lack of fiscal buffers directly led to its profound debt crisis, sovereign default, and subsequent reliance on external bailouts.<sup>23</sup> The ability to build and maintain fiscal space through prudent management and strategic savings, such as Singapore's NIRC model, is therefore a critical determinant of a nation's resilience to economic shocks and its capacity to pursue long-term development goals. Countries like Sri Lanka, lacking such buffers, are compelled to implement reactive, often painful, austerity measures during crises, which can severely impact public services and long-term growth prospects. This underscores the profound long-term benefits of fiscal foresight and discipline in enabling a government to invest in its future and navigate unforeseen challenges without compromising stability.

#### Comparative Impact on Economic Stability, Development, and Social Equity

Sri Lanka continues to face significant economic instability, high inflation, and vulnerability to external shocks, largely exacerbated by its debt crisis.<sup>24</sup> Development is hindered by persistent fiscal constraints, a substantial brain drain of skilled professionals <sup>23</sup>, and documented inefficiencies in public investment.<sup>18</sup> Public services are strained, directly impacting the well-being and access for citizens to essential services like healthcare and education.<sup>26</sup>

Singapore, in contrast, enjoys macroeconomic stability and resilience, underpinned by robust fiscal buffers and a strong balance sheet.<sup>36</sup> Sustained economic growth is supported by strategic, long-term investments in human capital, innovation, and advanced infrastructure.<sup>36</sup> High-quality and accessible public services, coupled with progressive tax and transfer policies, actively promote social equity and mobility, ensuring that the benefits of economic progress are broadly shared.<sup>38</sup>

The comparison strongly suggests that robust governance and institutional strength are not merely ancillary factors but are fundamental enablers of effective fiscal policy. Sri Lanka's fiscal challenges are explicitly linked to "systemic and severe corruption vulnerabilities and governance weaknesses" <sup>21</sup>, which directly impact tax collection efficiency and the effectiveness of public investment. The IMF's governance diagnostic report and documented issues with data accuracy <sup>15</sup> further highlight these deep-seated institutional problems. Singapore, while not explicitly detailed in these snippets regarding governance challenges, implicitly demonstrates strong governance through its consistent fiscal prudence, effective revenue mobilization, and strategic long-term planning.<sup>36</sup> This consistent behavior and adherence to international standards reflect a strong institutional framework that ensures accountability, transparency, and efficient resource allocation. For Sri Lanka, therefore, sustainable fiscal recovery and improved public welfare depend not only on budgetary adjustments but critically on comprehensive governance reforms that address corruption and enhance institutional capacity.

### 6. Key Understandings and Policy Implications

The comparative analysis of government expenditure in Sri Lanka and Singapore provides several critical understandings and highlights key policy implications for nations navigating fiscal challenges.

#### Lessons from Singapore's Sustainable Fiscal Model

Singapore's success offers valuable lessons in sustainable fiscal management:

* Strategic Resource Accumulation and Management: The nation's experience underscores the immense value of accumulating and prudently managing national reserves. Leveraging the Net Investment Returns Contribution (NIRC) allows Singapore to fund significant public spending without heavy reliance on current taxation or accumulating substantial debt.<sup>36</sup> This demonstrates the importance of long-term wealth management and the strategic role of sovereign wealth funds in building fiscal resilience.
* Prudent Debt Philosophy: Singapore's approach of borrowing primarily for productive, long-term infrastructure projects rather than recurrent expenditure, and maintaining an effective "no net debt" position, provides unparalleled fiscal stability. This significantly reduces vulnerability to external financial shocks and maintains a strong credit rating.<sup>42</sup>
* Investment in Human and Physical Capital: Singapore's consistent prioritization and substantial investment of its budget in high-quality education, healthcare, and infrastructure is a deliberate long-term strategy. This approach enhances economic productivity, strengthens national competitiveness, and improves social well-being across the population.<sup>36</sup>
* Strong Governance and Fiscal Discipline: A robust institutional framework, characterized by transparency, accountability, and constitutional safeguards, is crucial for efficient resource allocation and effective policy implementation. This fosters trust and predictability, which are vital for both domestic stability and international investment.<sup>13</sup>

#### Strategic Considerations for Sri Lanka's Fiscal Recovery and Long-Term Stability

For Sri Lanka, the path to fiscal recovery and long-term stability requires a multi-faceted approach:

* Deep Fiscal Consolidation and Revenue Mobilization: Continuing and intensifying efforts to broaden the tax base, improve tax collection efficiency, and rationalize tax exemptions are paramount. These measures are essential to reduce the persistent budget deficit and alleviate the crippling debt burden.<sup>19</sup>
* Expenditure Rationalization and Prioritization: A critical shift is needed from unproductive recurrent expenditures, especially the high interest payments, towards growth-enhancing public investments in essential infrastructure and human capital.<sup>18</sup> This requires rigorous evaluation and prioritization of capital projects and comprehensive reforms of loss-making State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) that drain public funds.<sup>23</sup>
* Strengthening Governance and Institutions: Addressing systemic corruption vulnerabilities and governance weaknesses is fundamental to any sustainable recovery. This includes enhancing transparency in public finance, strengthening accountability mechanisms, and improving the overall efficiency of public administration.<sup>21</sup>
* Human Capital Retention and Development: Implementing targeted policies to stem the "brain drain" of skilled professionals <sup>23</sup> and making renewed investments in quality education and healthcare are vital for rebuilding the workforce and ensuring long-term economic recovery.
* Diversification and Export-Led Growth: Reducing over-reliance on vulnerable sectors and actively promoting export diversification are crucial for increasing foreign exchange reserves, reducing external debt vulnerability, and fostering sustainable economic growth.<sup>23</sup>

The comparison vividly illustrates two contrasting feedback loops in fiscal management. Singapore's prudent fiscal management, characterized by its substantial reserves, effective "no net debt" position, and strategic investment, creates a virtuous cycle of stability, resilience, and sustained growth. This allows the nation to proactively address future challenges, such as an aging population and rising healthcare costs. In stark contrast, Sri Lanka's historical fiscal mismanagement, marked by low revenue generation, high unproductive spending, and accumulating debt, led to a vicious cycle of crisis, severely constrained fiscal space, and a weakening of its human capital through brain drain. This highlights that fiscal policy is not a static set of numbers but a dynamic system with profound long-term consequences. A government's approach to expenditure and revenue has a compounding effect, either building resilience and opportunity or creating vulnerabilities and hindering development. For Sri Lanka, the path to recovery involves consciously breaking the vicious cycle by adopting disciplined, strategic fiscal practices that foster a virtuous cycle of growth and stability, much like Singapore's model.

Furthermore, this analysis underscores that fiscal decisions have profound intergenerational consequences. Singapore's constitutional framework for reserves and its NIRC model explicitly aim to ensure that "each generation contributes and benefits fairly from the Budget".<sup>36</sup> This means current generations benefit from past investments and accumulated wealth, while current prudence safeguards resources and opportunities for future generations. Conversely, Sri Lanka's severe debt crisis represents a significant burden passed onto future generations, as they will inherit the responsibility of servicing the accumulated debt and face limitations in public services due to constrained fiscal space. This emphasizes that prudent fiscal management, including the accumulation of reserves and strategic debt issuance, can promote intergenerational equity by ensuring that future generations inherit a strong economic foundation and the capacity to fund their own public services. Conversely, unsustainable fiscal policies can create a legacy of debt and limited opportunities, effectively taxing future generations for current consumption. Sri Lanka's recovery efforts must therefore explicitly consider their long-term impact on intergenerational fairness and aim to build a more sustainable fiscal future.

### 7. Conclusion

The critical analysis of government expenditure as a percentage of GDP in Sri Lanka and Singapore reveals stark differences in their fiscal health, expenditure effectiveness, and underlying economic philosophies, despite potential numerical similarities in total spending under certain definitions.

Sri Lanka's fiscal landscape is characterized by the heavy burden of debt servicing, inefficient public investment, and systemic governance challenges. These factors have significantly contributed to its recent economic crisis and continue to constrain its capacity to provide essential public services and foster long-term growth. While ongoing reforms are crucial, they face significant structural hurdles rooted in deep-seated fiscal imbalances and institutional weaknesses.

Singapore, in contrast, exemplifies a highly prudent and strategic fiscal model. By leveraging substantial national reserves through the Net Investment Returns Contribution, maintaining an effective "no net debt" position, and consistently prioritizing investments in human capital and infrastructure, Singapore has built a resilient economy. This approach has enabled the provision of high-quality public services and established a strong foundation for future prosperity, demonstrating the profound benefits of long-term fiscal foresight and discipline.

Ultimately, this comparison underscores that the _quality_, _composition_, and _efficiency_ of government expenditure, coupled with robust governance and sustainable revenue generation, are far more indicative of a nation's fiscal health and developmental trajectory than the sheer percentage of GDP allocated to public spending. Sri Lanka's journey toward sustainable recovery can draw valuable lessons from Singapore's disciplined, long-term approach to public finance, particularly in prioritizing productive investments, strengthening revenue administration, and enhancing institutional governance.
