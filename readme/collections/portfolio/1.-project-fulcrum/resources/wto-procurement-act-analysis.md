## The WTO Agreement on Government Procurement: A Synthesis of Rationale, Mechanics, and Global Impact

### Part I: The Rationale for International Disciplines on Government Procurement

#### Section 1: The Governance and Trade Anomaly of Public Spending

The existence of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) is a direct response to a significant and deliberate anomaly within the architecture of the post-war multilateral trading system. While the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) of 1947 laid the groundwork for decades of trade liberalization based on principles of non-discrimination, it contained a critical carve-out for one of the largest sectors of any national economy: government procurement. The creation and evolution of the GPA can only be fully understood as a corrective measure designed to address the profound economic and governance distortions that arose from this foundational exclusion. Its primary function is not merely to open new markets, but to remedy a long-standing gap in the rules-based international order, making it a unique instrument of both trade policy and domestic governance reform.

**The Foundational Exclusion**

The core principles of the GATT, which were carried over into the WTO, are national treatment (NT) and most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment. The national treatment obligation, articulated in Article III of the GATT, requires that once imported goods have entered a market, they must be treated no less favourably than "like" domestic products in terms of internal taxes and regulations.<sup>1</sup> This principle is the bedrock of fair competition, designed to prevent countries from using domestic policies to undermine tariff concessions and protect local industries. However, the drafters of the GATT explicitly exempted government purchasing from this cornerstone rule.

Article III:8(a) of the GATT 1994 states that the provisions of the national treatment article "shall not apply to laws, regulations or requirements governing the procurement by governmental agencies of products purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view to commercial resale".<sup>2</sup> A similar exclusion exists in Article XVII concerning state trading enterprises and in Article XIII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS).<sup>2</sup> This meant that governments were legally free under the main WTO agreements to discriminate in favour of domestic suppliers, to be non-transparent in their purchasing decisions, and to maintain overtly protectionist "Buy National" policies.<sup>2</sup> This was not an oversight but a deliberate decision to preserve national sovereignty over public expenditure, effectively insulating a massive segment of economic activity from international competition rules.<sup>4</sup> This carve-out created what has been described as a major "hole" in the multilateral trading system, leaving a critical area of trade policy unregulated by the core disciplines that governed other commercial transactions.<sup>7</sup>

**Economic and Governance Consequences**

The consequences of this exclusion were profound and multifaceted, creating significant economic inefficiencies and fostering poor governance. By shielding public procurement from international competition, governments created closed, protected markets with predictable negative outcomes.

First, the lack of international competition led to significant economic inefficiency and poor value for money for taxpayers. "Buy National" policies, by limiting the pool of potential suppliers, often resulted in governments paying inflated prices for goods and services of potentially lower quality.<sup>8</sup> Public purchasing, funded by taxpayer money, was thus conducted without the competitive pressures that ensure efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the private sector.<sup>3</sup> This protectionism acted as a significant non-tariff barrier to trade, retarding global economic growth and imposing substantial costs on national budgets.<sup>4</sup> Studies have estimated that such protectionist measures can impose a cost of 5 to 10 percent on taxpayers through inflated prices, amounting to government waste that could exceed $100 billion annually in a large economy like the United States.<sup>8</sup>

Second, the opacity of these protected procurement systems created a fertile environment for corruption, conflicts of interest, and cronyism.<sup>5</sup> Without the discipline of transparent and fair procedures, procurement decisions could be influenced by factors other than price and quality, undermining the integrity and predictability of public financial management.<sup>5</sup> The preamble to the revised GPA explicitly recognizes the importance of avoiding such practices, linking transparent procurement to international anti-corruption instruments like the United Nations Convention Against Corruption.<sup>5</sup> Some estimates suggest that, on a global average, corruption increases the price of government procurement contracts by as much as 25 percent, highlighting the inadequacy of purely domestic laws in addressing the problem.<sup>11</sup> This recognition underscores that the problems stemming from the GATT exclusion were not just about trade, but about fundamental issues of good governance and the sound management of public resources.<sup>5</sup>

The scale of the government procurement market magnified the impact of these distortions. In most countries, public procurement represents a substantial portion of the economy, typically estimated to be between 12 and 20 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).<sup>3</sup> This enormous market, worth trillions of dollars annually on a global scale, became a critical issue for international trade policy.<sup>15</sup> As governments became more aware of the economic costs of inadequate procurement regulations, opening these markets to international competition and harmonizing domestic rules emerged as a crucial objective for enhancing economic performance and promoting development.<sup>15</sup> The GPA was conceived as the primary instrument to achieve this, transforming public procurement from a bastion of protectionism into a central pillar of the international trading system.<sup>15</sup>

#### Section 2: The Plurilateral Solution

The path chosen to integrate government procurement into the rules-based trading system was not the standard multilateral route, which would have required the consensus of all WTO members. Instead, the GPA was established as a plurilateral agreement, a framework that is both the source of its greatest strength and the cause of its most persistent weakness. This "coalition of the willing" model was a pragmatic response to the deep divisions among WTO members regarding the liberalization of such a politically sensitive area, allowing for the creation of an ambitious and deeply integrated agreement that would have been impossible to achieve multilaterally.

**The "Coalition of the Willing" Model**

A plurilateral agreement, in WTO parlance, is a legal instrument to which only a subset of the WTO membership are parties.<sup>5</sup> Unlike multilateral agreements, such as the GATT or GATS, which are part of the "single undertaking" and bind all 164 WTO members, plurilateral agreements are voluntary.<sup>21</sup> The GPA is the most prominent and enduring example of a plurilateral agreement listed under Annex 4 of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the WTO.<sup>2</sup>

The decision to pursue a plurilateral path for government procurement was born of necessity. Given the explicit exclusion of procurement from core GATT disciplines and the reluctance of many countries, particularly developing nations, to surrender policy space in this area, achieving a multilateral consensus was politically unfeasible.<sup>2</sup> Many governments viewed procurement as a key tool for industrial policy, support for domestic firms, and other national objectives, making them unwilling to subject it to binding international rules on non-discrimination.<sup>23</sup> The plurilateral framework provided a way forward, allowing a group of like-minded countries, primarily developed economies, to negotiate deeper commitments among themselves without being held back by the lack of universal agreement.<sup>4</sup> The underlying logic was that the benefits of joining this "club" would eventually attract other WTO members to accede, gradually expanding its reach.<sup>2</sup>

**Contrasting Plurilateral and Multilateral Agreements**

The distinction between these two types of agreements is fundamental to the WTO's architecture. Multilateral agreements represent the ideal of a universal, rules-based system where all members are bound by the same set of obligations, ensuring a level playing field. The negotiation process, however, is often slow and cumbersome, as it requires consensus among a large and diverse membership, as exemplified by the stalled Doha Development Agenda.<sup>22</sup>

Plurilateral agreements offer a more flexible and targeted alternative.<sup>21</sup> They allow groups of members to move ahead on specific issues where broader consensus is lacking, potentially acting as "building blocks" for future multilateral rules or as laboratories for new approaches to trade governance.<sup>21</sup> This flexibility enables the negotiation of more ambitious and detailed rules than would be possible in a multilateral setting.<sup>4</sup> However, this approach is not without controversy. Critics argue that it can lead to the fragmentation of the multilateral system, creating a "two-tier" WTO where non-participants are excluded from the benefits of liberalization and may suffer from negative externalities like trade diversion.<sup>21</sup>

**Implications of the Plurilateral Framework**

The GPA's plurilateral nature has defined its character and trajectory. On one hand, it has allowed the agreement to become a sophisticated and legally binding instrument with "hard law" provisions that go far beyond what a multilateral consensus could have produced.<sup>2</sup> The detailed rules on tendering procedures, transparency, and domestic review mechanisms reflect a high level of ambition that was only possible among a self-selected group of countries committed to deep integration in this area.<sup>14</sup>

On the other hand, this exclusivity is the agreement's primary limitation. Its membership, while growing, remains limited, composed mainly of developed countries.<sup>4</sup> This has led to criticisms that the GPA is a "rich countries' club" and has raised concerns about its overall impact and legitimacy within the broader WTO system.<sup>7</sup> Non-members not only miss out on the market access opportunities but may also see their bargaining power in other trade negotiations erode.<sup>21</sup>

This structure creates a fundamental paradox. The very feature that enables the GPA's depth and effectiveness—its voluntary, plurilateral nature—is also the source of its primary weakness: its limited breadth and the systemic friction it generates. The agreement's success is confined to its parties, and the high standards it sets can act as a barrier to entry for developing countries with capacity constraints. This paradox places the GPA at the center of the debate about the future of the WTO. It stands as a successful model for making progress in a deadlocked multilateral environment, but it does so by institutionalizing a form of variable geometry that challenges the WTO's foundational principle of a single, unified system for all its members.<sup>22</sup>

#### Section 3: Historical Trajectory - From the Tokyo Code to the Revised GPA

The Agreement on Government Procurement did not emerge fully formed but has evolved over more than four decades through successive rounds of negotiation. This historical trajectory reflects a continuous process of expansion and deepening, transforming a limited and narrowly focused code into a comprehensive and modern international treaty. Each iteration of the agreement has built upon the last, progressively broadening its coverage, strengthening its disciplines, and adapting its rules to contemporary procurement practices and global economic realities.

**The Origins (1979-1994)**

The first international efforts to regulate government procurement began within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) before being brought into the Tokyo Round of GATT negotiations in 1976.<sup>25</sup> This culminated in the signing of the first Agreement on Government Procurement in 1979, commonly known as the "Tokyo Round Government Procurement Code," which entered into force in 1981.<sup>25</sup>

This initial code was a modest first step. Its scope was strictly limited, applying only to the procurement of _goods_ by specified _central government entities_ of its signatories.<sup>4</sup> Services and purchases by sub-central government bodies were not covered. The agreement established foundational obligations of non-discrimination (both national treatment and MFN) and transparency for covered procurements above a certain value threshold, which was initially set at 150,000 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs).<sup>4</sup> In 1987, the Code was amended to expand its coverage slightly, adding a limited number of services (such as construction) and lowering the threshold for goods to SDR 130,000.<sup>4</sup> Despite its limitations, the Tokyo Code was a landmark achievement, as it represented the first time that government procurement was brought under the discipline of an international trade agreement.<sup>4</sup>

**The WTO GPA (1994/1996)**

The next major evolution occurred in parallel with the Uruguay Round of negotiations (1986-1994), which led to the creation of the WTO. Negotiators seized this opportunity to substantially revise and expand the procurement code. The result was the 1994 Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA), which was signed in Marrakesh on April 15, 1994, and entered into force on January 1, 1996, alongside the other WTO agreements.<sup>4</sup>

The 1994 GPA represented a quantum leap in scope and ambition compared to its predecessor. Its most significant achievement was the substantial expansion of its coverage.<sup>25</sup> The agreement was broadened to include not only goods but also

_services_ and _construction services_.<sup>4</sup> Furthermore, its coverage was extended beyond central government entities to include, for the first time, procurement by

_sub-central government entities_ (such as states, provinces, and prefectures) and _other entities_ like public utilities and state-owned enterprises, provided they were listed in a signatory's schedule of commitments.<sup>4</sup> This expansion dramatically increased the value of procurement opportunities covered by the agreement. The 1994 GPA also strengthened the procedural rules and laid the groundwork for the domestic bid-challenge mechanisms that would become a hallmark of the agreement's enforcement system.<sup>7</sup>

**The Revised GPA (2012/2014)**

The 1994 agreement contained a built-in mandate for future negotiations to further improve and expand its disciplines.<sup>10</sup> These negotiations began in 1997 and, after more than a decade of work, culminated in a comprehensive revision of the GPA, which was formally adopted on March 30, 2012.<sup>18</sup> The revised GPA entered into force on April 6, 2014, after two-thirds of the parties had deposited their instruments of acceptance.<sup>30</sup>

This revision was a complete overhaul of the agreement, aimed at modernizing its text, expanding market access, and enhancing its role as an instrument of good governance.<sup>10</sup> The key achievements of the 2012 revision can be grouped into three main areas:

1. Modernization of the Text: The revised text was streamlined and rewritten to make it more logical, user-friendly, and easier to understand.<sup>10</sup> Crucially, the rules were updated to reflect developments in modern procurement practices, most notably the widespread use of electronic tools. The agreement now explicitly recognizes and encourages the use of e-procurement, offering greater flexibility, such as shorter time limits for tendering, when electronic means are used.<sup>5</sup>
2. Expansion of Market Access: The 2012 revision secured significant new market access commitments from its parties. This was achieved by adding more than 200 new government entities to the agreement's coverage, including central, sub-central, and other entities across various parties.<sup>31</sup> Coverage was also expanded to new services sectors, and some parties reduced their monetary thresholds, further increasing the scope of covered procurement.<sup>32</sup> The WTO estimated that these new commitments would open up an additional $80 billion to $100 billion in procurement opportunities annually.<sup>9</sup>
3. Enhanced Governance and Flexibility: The revised GPA places a much stronger and more explicit emphasis on good governance. The text now directly references the need to avoid conflicts of interest and prevent corrupt practices, explicitly linking the agreement's objectives to the global fight against corruption.<sup>5</sup> At the same time, the agreement introduced more flexible provisions and a more structured approach to special and differential treatment (S\&D) for developing countries. These measures, which include the possibility of transitional arrangements like phased-in coverage and higher initial thresholds, were designed to make it easier for developing nations to accede to the agreement and integrate into the global procurement market.<sup>5</sup>

The following table summarizes the key milestones in the GPA's evolution, illustrating its steady progression from a limited code to a comprehensive global standard for public procurement.

### Part II: The Architecture of the Agreement on Government Procurement

The Agreement on Government Procurement is a complex legal instrument with a detailed architecture designed to translate its broad objectives into enforceable obligations. This architecture is built upon two cornerstone principles—non-discrimination and transparency—which are given practical effect through a carefully calibrated system of coverage, a set of detailed procedural disciplines for conducting procurements, and a dual-track enforcement mechanism. Understanding this structure is essential for appreciating how the GPA functions in practice to open markets, ensure fair competition, and promote good governance.

#### Section 4: The Cornerstone Principles in Practice - Non-Discrimination and Transparency

At the heart of the GPA are the twin principles of non-discrimination and transparency. These are not merely aspirational goals but legally binding obligations that form the foundation of the entire agreement.<sup>19</sup> Their implementation serves a dual mandate that makes the GPA a powerful instrument of "deep integration": they facilitate market access for foreign firms, a traditional trade objective, while simultaneously imposing high standards of good governance on domestic procurement systems, a domestic policy objective. This dual function blurs the line between international trade law and national administrative reform, using a trade agreement as a lever to drive improvements in domestic accountability and the rule of law.

**Non-Discrimination**

The principle of non-discrimination is the GPA's primary tool for dismantling protectionist barriers in public procurement.<sup>2</sup> It is expressed through two core obligations that mirror those found in the main WTO agreements, but which are specifically applied to the procurement activities covered by the GPA.

First, the principle of National Treatment (NT) requires that each GPA party must provide to the goods, services, and suppliers of any other GPA party treatment "no less favourable" than the treatment it provides to its own domestic goods, services, and suppliers.<sup>18</sup> This obligation directly confronts and prohibits "Buy National" policies and other forms of domestic preference within the scope of the agreement's coverage.<sup>1</sup> It ensures that foreign suppliers from GPA countries can compete on a level playing field with local firms for covered government contracts.<sup>18</sup>

Second, the principle of Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) Treatment prohibits discrimination among foreign suppliers. A GPA party cannot grant an advantage to the goods, services, or suppliers of one GPA party without granting that same advantage to the goods, services, and suppliers of all other GPA parties.<sup>1</sup> This ensures that the benefits of the agreement are extended equally to all its members, preventing the creation of preferential arrangements within the "club."

It is crucial to note, however, that these powerful non-discrimination obligations are not absolute. They apply only to procurements that are explicitly covered by a party's specific schedule of commitments.<sup>2</sup> As will be discussed further, the GPA's architecture allows for significant exceptions and exclusions, meaning that parties can and do maintain discriminatory practices in areas they have not opened up under the agreement.<sup>2</sup>

**Transparency**

Transparency is the second cornerstone of the GPA, and it is essential for making the non-discrimination principle effective in practice. Without transparency, discriminatory practices can be easily hidden, and suppliers cannot meaningfully access the opportunities to which they are entitled. The GPA's transparency obligations are comprehensive, covering the entire procurement lifecycle.<sup>18</sup>

The agreement mandates publication of procurement systems and opportunities. Parties are required to publish their national laws, regulations, judicial decisions, and administrative rulings related to government procurement, ensuring that the rules of the game are clear and publicly accessible.<sup>38</sup> More practically, procuring entities must publish a notice of intended procurement for each covered contract in a designated and widely disseminated medium.<sup>18</sup> The 2012 revision modernized this requirement by strongly encouraging the use of electronic means, and the WTO now maintains an e-GPA portal that serves as a single point of access for these opportunities.<sup>18</sup> After a contract is awarded, entities must also publish a notice of the award, including the name of the winning bidder and the value of the contract.<sup>18</sup>

The GPA also requires procedural transparency. The tender documentation provided to potential suppliers must be comprehensive and contain all the information necessary for them to prepare and submit a responsive bid. This includes a complete description of the goods or services required, the conditions for participation, and all the criteria that will be used for awarding the contract.<sup>18</sup> This ensures that the process is predictable and that suppliers are competing on a known and equal basis.

This deep commitment to transparency serves a purpose that extends beyond trade liberalization. It is a powerful anti-corruption tool. By requiring that procurement processes be open to public scrutiny, the GPA makes it much more difficult to engage in corrupt practices, favoritism, or conflicts of interest.<sup>5</sup> The preamble of the revised GPA explicitly recognizes this link, stating the importance of "carrying out procurements in a transparent and impartial manner and of avoiding conflicts of interest and corrupt practices".<sup>5</sup> This good governance dimension is a defining feature of the agreement. The GPA's rules on transparency and procedural fairness are not just about ensuring foreign firms get a fair shot; they are about embedding principles of accountability, integrity, and sound financial management into the domestic procurement systems of its members.<sup>10</sup> This is reinforced by the GPA's synergy with instruments like the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement, a template for best-practice domestic legislation, which was itself reformed to align with the revised GPA.<sup>15</sup> The GPA thus uses the leverage of an international trade agreement to drive positive domestic administrative reform.

#### Section 5: Defining the Boundaries - Coverage, Thresholds, and Exclusions

The GPA's power and reach are not uniform or absolute. Instead, the agreement employs a flexible and highly negotiated architecture of "managed reciprocity." This system allows each party to tailor the extent of its commitments, balancing its desire for access to foreign markets with the political need to protect sensitive domestic sectors. This is achieved through a "positive list" approach, where a party is only bound by what it explicitly agrees to cover in detailed schedules, which are further qualified by monetary thresholds and specific exclusions. The result is a complex and fragmented system where the true scope of market access is not found in the main text of the agreement but is buried within hundreds of pages of annexes, posing a significant navigational challenge for businesses and policymakers alike.

**The "Positive List" Approach and Annex Structure**

Unlike multilateral agreements that apply broadly unless an exception is invoked, the GPA operates on a "positive list" or "bottom-up" basis.<sup>31</sup> This means the agreement's rules only apply to the specific procuring entities, goods, services, and construction services that a party has explicitly listed in its schedule of commitments, which forms Appendix I to the agreement.<sup>18</sup> If an entity or a category of procurement is not on the list, it is not covered by the GPA's disciplines.

Each party's schedule of commitments is meticulously organized into seven annexes, which define the precise scope of its obligations <sup>18</sup>:

* Annex 1: Central Government Entities: This annex lists the core executive branch agencies and ministries at the national level whose procurement is covered (e.g., in the U.S., the Department of Commerce or the Department of the Treasury).
* Annex 2: Sub-Central Government Entities: This lists covered entities at the sub-national level, such as states, provinces, or prefectures. This coverage is often a major point of negotiation and varies significantly between parties. For example, the United States has listed 37 of its 50 states, while the EU's commitments cover its regional and local contracting authorities more comprehensively.<sup>3</sup>
* Annex 3: Other Entities: This is a catch-all category for other public or quasi-public bodies, such as utilities (in sectors like electricity or water), state-owned enterprises, and other government-controlled organizations that are not part of the central or sub-central government structure.<sup>18</sup>
* Annex 4: Goods: This annex specifies the goods covered by the agreement. While coverage is generally broad, parties can list specific exceptions.
* Annex 5: Services: This annex uses a classification system to list the specific service sectors that a party agrees to open to competition (e.g., management consulting, IT services, accounting services).
* Annex 6: Construction Services: This annex details the coverage for construction-related contracts.
* Annex 7: General Notes: This is a critically important annex where parties can specify cross-cutting exceptions, derogations, and other qualifying conditions that apply to their commitments. For example, the United States uses its General Notes to exclude set-asides for small and minority-owned businesses from the GPA's obligations.<sup>2</sup>

This structure is the foundation of the GPA's system of reciprocity. A country's offer to open its market is carefully calibrated based on the offers it receives from other parties. Negotiations often involve detailed, line-by-line bargaining over which entities and sectors to include.<sup>19</sup> The goal is not necessarily identical coverage but access to "comparable opportunities".<sup>19</sup> This creates a complex patchwork of commitments, where a U.S. company's right to bid on a contract in Japan depends on the specific entity issuing the tender, the type of service being procured, and the contents of Japan's annexes.

**Monetary Thresholds**

In addition to being listed in the annexes, a procurement contract must also meet a minimum value for the GPA rules to apply. These monetary thresholds are a key mechanism for limiting the agreement's scope, carving out smaller contracts that governments may wish to reserve for domestic suppliers.<sup>18</sup>

The thresholds are not uniform. They vary depending on:

* The Procuring Entity: Central government entities typically have lower thresholds than sub-central entities or other entities like utilities.<sup>18</sup>
* The Type of Procurement: Thresholds for goods and services are generally lower than those for construction services.<sup>18</sup>
* The Party: While there are common benchmarks, parties can and do negotiate different threshold levels.<sup>33</sup>

These thresholds are expressed in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), an international reserve asset created by the IMF, to insulate them from currency fluctuations. They are periodically updated and converted into national currencies.<sup>17</sup> To prevent circumvention, the GPA contains rules that prohibit procuring entities from splitting up a single procurement requirement into multiple smaller contracts with the intent of falling below the applicable threshold.<sup>43</sup>

**General Exceptions and Exclusions**

Finally, the GPA contains several broad exceptions that allow parties to deviate from their obligations under certain circumstances. These are crucial for preserving policy space for core government functions.

The agreement includes a national security exception, which allows a party to take any action it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests related to the procurement of arms, ammunition, or war materials, or procurement indispensable for national security or defence purposes.<sup>19</sup>

It also contains general exceptions modeled on Article XX of the GATT, which permit measures that are necessary to protect public morals, order, or safety; human, animal, or plant life or health; or intellectual property. It also allows for measures relating to the goods or services of persons with disabilities, philanthropic institutions, or prison labour.<sup>13</sup>

Beyond these general exceptions, the annexes themselves are replete with specific exclusions. Parties routinely exclude sensitive sectors or specific types of contracts. For example, the U.S. excludes federally funded mass transit and highway projects <sup>46</sup>, and parties often exclude the procurement of agricultural products under price support programs or services related to the management of public debt.<sup>3</sup> This intricate web of negotiated coverage, thresholds, and exceptions defines the practical reality of the GPA: it is not a treaty of complete free trade in government procurement, but a framework for a carefully managed and reciprocal exchange of market access concessions.

#### Section 6: Procedural Disciplines for Fair Competition

To ensure that the principles of non-discrimination and transparency are translated into meaningful commercial opportunities, the GPA establishes a detailed set of procedural disciplines that govern the entire procurement process, from the initial notice to the final contract award. These rules are designed to create a predictable, fair, and competitive environment, preventing procuring entities from using procedural tactics to favour domestic suppliers or create unnecessary obstacles to international trade. The agreement provides for three main types of tendering procedures, each with its own set of rules, and imposes strict requirements on the formulation of technical specifications and the qualification of suppliers.

**Tendering Procedures**

The GPA recognizes that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to tendering is not practical and therefore provides for three distinct methods. The choice of method has a significant impact on the level of competition and accessibility for suppliers, and the agreement sets out clear conditions for their use.<sup>10</sup>

1. Open Tendering: This is the default and most competitive method, under which all interested suppliers, both domestic and foreign, are permitted to submit a tender.<sup>5</sup> It maximizes competition and transparency. The GPA establishes minimum time periods for bidding in open procedures—typically not less than 40 days from the date of the notice—to ensure that all potential suppliers have adequate time to prepare and submit a responsive bid.<sup>18</sup>
2. Selective Tendering: Under this method, only suppliers that have been invited by the procuring entity may submit a tender.<sup>5</sup> To prevent this from becoming a discriminatory tool, the GPA strictly regulates the process. Invitations to participate must be extended in a non-discriminatory manner to domestic suppliers and suppliers from other GPA parties. If an entity maintains a permanent list of qualified suppliers, it must ensure that firms can apply for qualification at any time and are added to the list promptly if they meet the criteria.<sup>13</sup> The time limits for bidding are similar to those for open tendering.<sup>18</sup>
3. Limited Tendering: This is the most restrictive method, where a procuring entity contacts a supplier or suppliers of its choice directly, without a competitive call for tenders.<sup>5</sup> Its use is permitted only in specific, exceptional circumstances, such as cases of extreme urgency, when only one supplier can provide the required good or service (e.g., for technical reasons or due to intellectual property rights), or for additional deliveries from an original supplier. The GPA explicitly states that limited tendering shall not be used as a means to avoid competition or to discriminate against foreign suppliers.<sup>18</sup>

The following table provides a comparative overview of these three tendering procedures, clarifying their distinct features and the key rules governing their use.

Table 2: Comparison of GPA Tendering Procedures

| Tendering Method    | Description                                                     | Conditions for Use                                                                                                                    | Key Procedural Rules                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open Tendering      | All interested suppliers may submit a tender.                   | The default and preferred method for maximizing competition and transparency.<sup>5</sup>                                             | Notice of intended procurement must be published. Minimum time limits for submission of bids (e.g., 40 days) must be observed.<sup>18</sup>             |
| Selective Tendering | Only pre-qualified suppliers are invited to submit a tender.    | Can be used provided it does not discriminate. Often used for complex procurements where supplier capability is critical.<sup>5</sup> | Conditions for participation must be published. Qualification procedures must be fair and open to new entrants. Minimum time limits apply.<sup>18</sup> |
| Limited Tendering   | The procuring entity contacts suppliers of its choice directly. | Use is strictly limited to exceptional circumstances defined in the GPA (e.g., urgency, single-source, etc.).<sup>5</sup>             | Must not be used to avoid competition or discriminate. A report must be prepared justifying its use.<sup>18</sup>                                       |

**Technical Specifications**

A common method of disguised protectionism is the use of technical specifications that are tailored to the products of a specific domestic firm. To combat this, the GPA imposes strict disciplines on how procuring entities define their requirements.<sup>18</sup>

The agreement mandates that technical specifications shall not be prepared, adopted, or applied with a view to, or with the effect of, creating unnecessary obstacles to international trade.<sup>18</sup> Wherever possible, specifications should be based on

performance and functional requirements rather than on design or descriptive characteristics. This focuses on what the product or service must _do_, rather than what it must _be_, opening the door to a wider range of innovative solutions. Furthermore, procuring entities are required to base their technical specifications on international standards where they exist and are appropriate for the procurement concerned; otherwise, they should be based on national technical regulations or recognized national standards.<sup>18</sup> This prevents the use of unique national standards as a barrier to entry for foreign firms.

**Qualification of Suppliers**

The GPA also sets out rules to ensure that the process of qualifying suppliers to participate in a procurement is fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory. A procuring entity must not discriminate against a supplier from another GPA party in the qualification process.<sup>18</sup> Any conditions for participation—such as financial capacity, technical ability, and commercial experience—must be limited to those that are essential to ensure that a potential supplier has the capability to fulfill the contract in question.<sup>40</sup>

The assessment of a supplier's qualifications must be based on the conditions that have been specified in advance in the notices or tender documentation. Furthermore, the GPA prohibits discrimination against a locally established supplier on the basis of the degree of foreign affiliation or ownership, or on the basis that the goods or services supplied by that supplier are of foreign origin, provided they meet the conditions for participation.<sup>18</sup>

The agreement also provides a non-exhaustive list of grounds on which a party may exclude a supplier from participating in procurement. These grounds are permissive, not mandatory, and include reasons such as bankruptcy, false declarations, serious crimes, professional misconduct, or significant deficiencies in the performance of a prior contract.<sup>48</sup> Any such decision to disqualify a supplier must be based on supporting evidence and communicated promptly to the affected supplier, who has the right to request a written explanation of the reasons for the decision.<sup>48</sup>

#### Section 7: Ensuring Compliance - Domestic Review and WTO Dispute Settlement

A set of rules, no matter how well-crafted, is only as effective as the mechanisms in place to enforce it. The GPA is distinguished by its robust, dual-track enforcement system, which combines traditional state-to-state dispute settlement at the WTO with a groundbreaking requirement for domestic review mechanisms. This latter feature, which grants private companies the ability to directly challenge procurement decisions in a domestic forum, represents a profound innovation in international economic law. It effectively "domesticates" the GPA's obligations, creating a powerful, decentralized compliance tool that is more accessible and often more rapid than the formal WTO dispute settlement process.

**State-to-State Dispute Settlement**

Like other WTO agreements, the GPA is subject to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), the central pillar of the multilateral trading system.<sup>19</sup> This allows one GPA party to bring a formal complaint against another party that it believes is not complying with its obligations under the agreement.<sup>18</sup> The process involves stages of consultation, adjudication by a panel, and the possibility of appeal to the (currently non-functional) Appellate Body. If a party is found to be in violation of the GPA, it is expected to bring its measures into conformity.

However, there are important modifications to how the DSU applies to the GPA, reflecting its plurilateral nature. First, only GPA parties may participate in disputes arising under the agreement. Non-parties have no standing, even if their commercial interests are affected.<sup>49</sup> Second, and more significantly, the remedy of cross-retaliation is not permitted. This means that if a country wins a GPA dispute, it cannot retaliate by suspending concessions under other WTO agreements (like the GATT or GATS). Conversely, a country cannot suspend its GPA obligations in retaliation for a violation of a different WTO agreement.<sup>19</sup> This "ring-fencing" of the GPA isolates it from broader trade disputes, preserving the integrity of the reciprocal bargains struck within the agreement.

**Domestic Review ("Bid Challenge") Mechanisms**

While the state-to-state mechanism is important for resolving systemic issues, the true innovation of the GPA's enforcement architecture lies in its mandatory domestic review procedures, often referred to as "bid challenge" systems.<sup>7</sup> This mechanism empowers individual suppliers, giving them a direct tool to enforce their rights under the treaty.

The GPA mandates that each party must establish and maintain a timely, effective, transparent, and non-discriminatory administrative or judicial review procedure through which a supplier can challenge an alleged breach of the agreement in connection with a covered procurement.<sup>18</sup> This is a radical departure from the traditional model of international law, where private actors typically have no direct standing and must rely on their home government to espouse their claim on the international plane. Under the GPA, a company from Japan can, for example, directly initiate a legal challenge against a procuring entity in Canada in a Canadian forum, alleging a violation of the GPA's rules.<sup>30</sup>

To ensure these domestic procedures are meaningful, the GPA sets out detailed due process requirements. The challenge must be heard by a court or by an impartial and independent review body that has no interest in the outcome of the procurement and whose members are secure from external influence.<sup>18</sup> Hong Kong's dedicated "Review Body on Bid Challenges" is a concrete example of such an institution.<sup>30</sup>

The review body must have the authority to take prompt interim measures to preserve the supplier's opportunity to participate in the procurement, such as suspending the award process. It must also have the authority to recommend or order corrective action or compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which may be limited to the costs of preparing the bid or filing the complaint.<sup>51</sup>

Furthermore, the GPA guarantees participants in these proceedings significant procedural rights. These include the right to be heard before a decision is reached, the right to legal representation, access to all relevant proceedings and the evidentiary record, and the right to request that hearings take place in public.<sup>48</sup> If the initial review is conducted by a body that is not a court or is not independent of the procuring entity, the GPA requires that the supplier has the right to appeal the initial decision to an impartial administrative or judicial authority that

_is_ independent of the procuring entity.<sup>48</sup>

This system of mandatory domestic review is arguably the GPA's most powerful compliance tool. It decentralizes enforcement, placing it in the hands of the economic actors with the most direct interest in ensuring the rules are followed. It provides for more rapid remedies than the often lengthy WTO dispute settlement process and lowers the political and diplomatic threshold for action. By requiring domestic legal systems to provide a direct remedy for breaches of an international treaty, the GPA creates a potent feedback loop that reinforces the rule of law and embeds its principles deeply within the administrative and judicial fabric of its member states.

### Part III: Synthesis and Critical Analysis

The Agreement on Government Procurement is more than a collection of legal rules; it is a dynamic force with tangible impacts on international trade, domestic governance, and the broader political economy. A comprehensive synthesis requires moving beyond an analysis of its mechanics to a critical evaluation of its effects. This involves assessing the economic dividend it provides to businesses and taxpayers, recognizing its role as a catalyst for good governance, and confronting the persistent challenges and debates that surround its implementation and future evolution. The GPA emerges from this analysis as a profoundly influential, yet contested, instrument of global economic governance.

#### Section 8: The Economic Dividend - Assessing the Impact on Trade, Business, and Taxpayers

The primary and most frequently cited justification for the GPA is the substantial economic dividend it delivers. By dismantling protectionist barriers and fostering competition in a vast and previously closed sector of the global economy, the agreement creates a tripartite win: it opens new markets for businesses, delivers better value for money for taxpayers, and stimulates overall trade flows between its members. However, this clear economic logic exists in a state of constant political tension with the enduring appeal of protectionist "Buy National" policies, creating a dynamic where the diffuse economic benefits of openness are perpetually weighed against the concentrated political gains of protecting local firms.

**Market Access for Businesses**

For businesses in GPA member countries, the agreement's most direct benefit is the legally guaranteed access it provides to foreign government procurement markets. This is a market of enormous scale, with various estimates placing its total annual value at around A$$2.5trillion,US$$1.7 trillion, or £1.3 trillion.<sup>3</sup> The GPA transforms this market from a series of closed national preserves into a competitive international arena, creating significant new export opportunities for suppliers of goods and services.<sup>18</sup>

The 2012 revision of the GPA alone was estimated to expand market access by an additional $80 billion to $100 billion annually.<sup>9</sup> This expansion came from adding new procuring entities at both the central and sub-central levels, opening up new services sectors, and reducing value thresholds in several member countries.<sup>32</sup> For example, the revised agreement gave U.S. suppliers new access to over 150 additional central government entities in the European Union and new opportunities in the telecommunications sectors of several parties.<sup>32</sup> For many companies, particularly in sectors like medical devices, software, power equipment, and infrastructure construction, the GPA provides the primary, and sometimes only, legal basis for accessing foreign government contracts.<sup>54</sup>

**Economic Impact Studies**

This anecdotal evidence is supported by more rigorous economic analysis. Studies using gravity models of trade—a standard econometric tool for analyzing trade flows—have consistently found that GPA membership has a tangible and positive impact on trade between its parties. Research has demonstrated that the agreement fosters increased bilateral trade in both goods and services, as well as growth in outward foreign affiliate sales in the services sector.<sup>4</sup> These studies confirm that the GPA is not just a paper agreement but a driver of real economic integration, fulfilling its core objective of liberalizing and expanding international trade.<sup>4</sup>

**Value for Money for Taxpayers**

The benefits of the GPA extend beyond the business community to the general public. By mandating open and fair competition, the agreement helps governments—and by extension, their taxpayers—to achieve better value for money.<sup>10</sup> When procuring entities can choose from a wider pool of international suppliers, they are more likely to obtain higher quality goods and services at more competitive prices.<sup>9</sup> This increased competition and choice leads to more efficient use of public funds, reducing government waste and freeing up resources for other priorities.<sup>3</sup>

The alternative—protectionist policies like "Buy American" or "Buy British"—imposes a direct cost on taxpayers by forcing governments to purchase more expensive or lower-quality domestic products.<sup>3</sup> Economic analysis suggests that these laws can be equivalent to tariffs of 25 percent or more on public purchases, leading to significantly inflated costs for everything from infrastructure projects to routine public services.<sup>8</sup> The GPA's non-discrimination rules directly counter this tendency, promoting efficiency and fiscal responsibility in public spending.<sup>9</sup>

This creates a fundamental conflict at the heart of the political economy of procurement. The economic rationale for the GPA is compelling: its benefits of efficiency and value for money are widely distributed across the entire population of taxpayers. However, the "costs" of the GPA, such as a domestic firm losing a contract to a more competitive foreign bidder, are highly concentrated, visible, and politically potent. This asymmetry explains the persistent political pressure for protectionist measures and why governments, even within the GPA framework, often seek to carve out exceptions for politically sensitive sectors or to support specific domestic constituencies like small businesses.<sup>2</sup> The GPA's success, therefore, depends on the ongoing ability of its economic logic to overcome this countervailing political pressure.

#### Section 9: The GPA as a Catalyst for Good Governance

Beyond its direct economic impacts, the Agreement on Government Procurement functions as a powerful instrument for promoting good governance, transparency, and the rule of law in its member countries. The procedural disciplines and enforcement mechanisms embedded in the GPA are not merely technical rules for managing trade; they constitute a comprehensive framework for ensuring integrity, accountability, and impartiality in the management of public funds. For many countries, acceding to the GPA serves as both a roadmap and an external anchor for deep-seated domestic reforms, making the agreement a critical tool in the global fight against corruption and in the strengthening of public institutions.

**An Anti-Corruption Framework**

One of the most significant governance benefits of the GPA is its role as an anti-corruption framework. Public procurement is an area notoriously vulnerable to corruption due to the large sums of money involved and the discretion often afforded to public officials.<sup>16</sup> The GPA directly confronts this vulnerability through its unwavering emphasis on transparency and procedural fairness.

The agreement's requirements—to publish laws and tender notices, to provide clear and objective award criteria, to justify decisions in writing, and to conduct procurement in an impartial manner—collectively create an environment that is hostile to corrupt practices.<sup>5</sup> When the entire procurement process is open to scrutiny by competing suppliers and the public, it becomes significantly more difficult to steer contracts to favoured firms, accept bribes, or engage in conflicts of interest.<sup>11</sup> The revised GPA of 2012 made this anti-corruption dimension explicit, including in its preamble a recognition of "the importance of transparent measures... of avoiding conflicts of interest and corrupt practices, in accordance with applicable international instruments, such as the United Nations Convention Against Corruption".<sup>5</sup> Article IV of the revised text further requires parties to conduct procurement in a manner that "prevents corrupt practices".<sup>11</sup> This merging of trade and good governance concerns is a defining feature of the modern GPA, positioning it as a key international instrument in the global effort to enhance public sector integrity.<sup>14</sup>

**An Anchor for Domestic Reform**

For countries undertaking the challenging process of reforming their public finance and administrative systems, the GPA can serve as a powerful external anchor. The process of acceding to the agreement requires a country to bring its domestic laws and procurement practices into compliance with the GPA's high standards.<sup>19</sup> This provides a clear and internationally recognized template for reform, often leveraging the UNCITRAL Model Law on Public Procurement as a benchmark.<sup>15</sup>

For domestic reformers facing resistance from entrenched vested interests that benefit from the status quo of an opaque system, the goal of GPA accession can provide the necessary political leverage to push through difficult changes.<sup>16</sup> By making a binding international commitment, a government can "lock in" reforms, making them more resilient to subsequent political pressures to revert to old, less transparent practices.<sup>15</sup> The GPA thus becomes not just a set of rules to follow, but a strategic policy tool used to drive a domestic agenda of modernization and good governance.<sup>10</sup> The recent accession of countries like Australia and the pursuit of accession by countries like Brazil are often framed in this context, as part of a broader effort to improve public sector efficiency and combat corruption.<sup>39</sup>

**Promoting Predictability and Rule of Law**

Ultimately, the GPA's governance impact lies in its contribution to the rule of law. By replacing arbitrary and opaque decision-making with a system based on clear, predictable, and enforceable rules, the agreement strengthens the legal and institutional framework governing a significant portion of state activity.<sup>5</sup> The requirement to establish impartial and independent domestic review bodies, where suppliers can challenge government decisions and obtain redress, is a particularly powerful manifestation of this principle.<sup>25</sup>

This rules-based system benefits all economic actors, both domestic and foreign. It creates a more predictable and stable business environment, reduces risks for investors, and fosters greater trust in public institutions.<sup>5</sup> When businesses know that procurement decisions will be made based on published criteria and that they have recourse to an effective remedy in case of unfair treatment, they are more likely to invest the time and resources needed to compete for government contracts. In this sense, the GPA's contribution to good governance is not an incidental byproduct of its trade objectives; it is a central and indispensable element of its success. The integrity and predictability of procurement systems are integral to the efficient management of public resources, the performance of national economies, and the proper functioning of the multilateral trading system itself.<sup>5</sup>

#### Section 10: Persistent Challenges and Enduring Debates

Despite its successes as an instrument of trade liberalization and good governance, the Agreement on Government Procurement is not without its critics and faces a number of persistent challenges. These challenges stem from its ambitious and intrusive nature, its unique plurilateral structure, and the inherent tension between its core principles and other legitimate public policy objectives. The most significant debates revolve around the difficulties developing countries face in implementation, the constraints the agreement places on national policy space, and the systemic issues arising from its limited membership.

**Implementation Challenges for Developing Countries**

While the revised GPA includes more flexible provisions for special and differential treatment (S\&D) to facilitate the accession of developing countries, significant hurdles remain.<sup>5</sup> Many developing nations lack the institutional capacity and technical expertise required to implement the GPA's complex rules.<sup>16</sup> This includes the capacity to reform domestic legislation, establish and operate transparent e-procurement systems, and manage sophisticated tendering processes in accordance with the agreement's detailed disciplines.<sup>58</sup> The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has highlighted that a lack of resources, limited funding, and the need for extensive training are major impediments for developing countries in implementing complex trade agreements.<sup>57</sup>

Furthermore, the political and economic costs of accession can be prohibitive. The process requires a significant investment in legal and administrative reform, which can be a daunting task for resource-constrained governments.<sup>16</sup> Moreover, efforts to increase transparency and competition often face strong resistance from entrenched domestic vested interests that benefit from the existing opaque and protectionist systems.<sup>16</sup> This combination of capacity constraints, high costs, and political opposition helps to explain why the GPA's membership has remained largely confined to developed economies, despite the accession of some developing countries in recent years.<sup>4</sup>

**The Policy Space Debate**

Perhaps the most fundamental criticism of the GPA is that it constrains the "policy space" of governments to use public procurement as a tool for achieving other important public policy goals.<sup>23</sup> Governments have historically used their purchasing power to promote domestic industrial development, support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), foster innovation, and pursue social or environmental objectives.<sup>9</sup>

The GPA's core principle of non-discrimination is often in direct conflict with these objectives, as preferential treatment is a key mechanism for achieving them.<sup>7</sup> While the agreement allows parties to negotiate specific exceptions—such as the U.S. carve-out for its small and minority business set-aside programs—the default orientation of the agreement is toward market-opening and competition, not targeted industrial or social policy.<sup>2</sup> Critics argue that this framework disproportionately benefits large, established multinational corporations and makes it more difficult for developing countries to nurture their own emerging industries, a strategy that many of today's developed countries themselves used in the past.<sup>24</sup> This debate highlights a core philosophical tension in global economic governance: the balance between the efficiency gains from liberalized trade and the sovereign right of nations to regulate in the public interest and pursue their own development paths.<sup>23</sup>

**Limited Membership and Systemic Issues**

The plurilateral nature of the GPA, while a pragmatic solution to the lack of multilateral consensus, is also the source of systemic challenges. The agreement's limited membership is its most frequently cited weakness.<sup>7</sup> Because its benefits are restricted to its signatories, it creates a "club" from which the majority of WTO members are excluded. This can lead to trade diversion, where procurement is shifted from more efficient non-member suppliers to less efficient member suppliers, and it can weaken the bargaining power of non-members in the broader trading system.<sup>21</sup>

The accession of new members, particularly large emerging economies, presents its own set of challenges. The ongoing accession negotiation with China, for example, is a source of both opportunity and concern for existing members.<sup>16</sup> While China's entry would vastly expand the market covered by the GPA, its state-led economic model and aggressive use of price competition raise complex issues that must be addressed in its terms of accession.<sup>4</sup> The process of accession itself is arduous, requiring detailed negotiations on market access offers and a determination by all existing parties that the applicant's domestic system is fully compliant with the GPA's rules.<sup>19</sup> This high bar, combined with the challenges mentioned above, ensures that the expansion of the GPA will likely remain a slow and incremental process.

The following table provides a balanced summary of the key arguments surrounding the GPA, encapsulating the main benefits that drive its adoption and the significant criticisms and challenges that continue to shape the debate over its role and future.

| Good Governance & Anti-Corruption: Establishes a transparent, rules-based framework that helps to prevent corruption, cronyism, and conflicts of interest in public spending.<sup>5</sup>                       | Implementation Burden for Developing Countries: High costs and capacity constraints make it difficult for many developing nations to accede to and implement the agreement's complex rules.<sup>16</sup>           |
| Legal Predictability & Rule of Law: Creates a stable and predictable legal environment for procurement and strengthens the rule of law through its robust domestic review and challenge mechanisms.<sup>5</sup> | Complexity and Fragmentation: The "positive list" and negotiated schedule approach results in a highly complex and fragmented system of commitments that can be difficult for businesses to navigate.<sup>19</sup> |

#### Section 11: Conclusion - The Future of the GPA in a Shifting Global Order

The World Trade Organization's Agreement on Government Procurement stands as one of the most ambitious and sophisticated instruments in the landscape of international economic law. It is a testament to what can be achieved through focused, rules-based cooperation. The preceding analysis reveals that the GPA is far more than a simple "procurement act." It is a complex, multi-layered treaty that functions simultaneously as a trade liberalization tool, a framework for good governance, and a pragmatic, if imperfect, solution to a foundational anomaly in the multilateral trading system. Its journey from a limited GATT code to a comprehensive, modern agreement reflects the evolving priorities of the global economy. Yet, its future is intertwined with the broader challenges facing the WTO and the shifting dynamics of international relations, making its trajectory a crucial indicator for the future of plurilateral cooperation.

The synthesis of the GPA's rationale, mechanics, and impact demonstrates its dual identity. On one hand, it is a powerful market-opening agreement that has unlocked trillions of dollars in commercial opportunities, fostering competition and delivering better value for taxpayers. On the other hand, it is an intrusive instrument of deep integration that imposes high standards of transparency, procedural fairness, and accountability on the domestic administrative systems of its parties, serving as a potent anti-corruption tool and an anchor for domestic reform. Its most radical innovation—the mandatory domestic bid-challenge mechanism—empowers private actors to enforce an international treaty's rules in national courts, a profound step in the "domestication" of international law that ensures the agreement has real teeth.

However, the very features that make the GPA effective also generate its primary challenges. Its plurilateral nature, a "coalition of the willing" approach, was necessary for its creation but has resulted in a system of limited membership that raises questions of inclusivity and systemic fairness. The high standards it sets create significant implementation burdens for developing countries, while its core principle of non-discrimination exists in a constant state of tension with the legitimate desire of sovereign governments to use public spending as an instrument of industrial and social policy.

Looking forward, the GPA is more than just a mature agreement; it is a critical test case and a potential blueprint for the future of the WTO's negotiating function. With the multilateral Doha Round stalled for years, the GPA's plurilateral model is increasingly seen as the most viable path for making progress on pressing 21st-century trade issues.<sup>22</sup> New plurilateral initiatives on e-commerce, investment facilitation for development, and services domestic regulation are, in many respects, following the trail blazed by the GPA.<sup>27</sup> The successes and failures of the GPA—its ability to forge deep rules versus its struggle to attract broad membership; its effectiveness in ensuring compliance versus the legitimacy challenges it faces from non-members—offer indispensable lessons for these new endeavors.

The future evolution of the GPA will be shaped by several key factors. The accession of major economies, most notably China, will be a transformative event, testing the agreement's capacity to integrate a different economic model while maintaining the integrity of its disciplines.<sup>16</sup> The persistent tension between the GPA's non-discrimination rules and the resurgence of national industrial policies and "Buy National" sentiment in a time of geopolitical friction will continue to test the political commitment of its members.<sup>8</sup> Ultimately, the GPA's ability to navigate these challenges, expand its membership, and remain a vital and relevant instrument will not only determine its own future but will also serve as a harbinger for the broader viability of rules-based plurilateralism as a sustainable model for governing the global economy. Its story is, in essence, a microcosm of the fundamental dilemma facing the WTO: how to balance the pursuit of deeper, more ambitious integration among the willing with the foundational goal of a truly universal and inclusive multilateral trading system.
