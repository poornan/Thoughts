>
> B: didn't get it&#x20;
>
> A: Audi-o, Audi-torium, Audi-tion, Audi-ence. "Audi" is the common root, then with each suffix the meaning changes. What is it?
>
> C: Nope
>
> B: Nope
>
> A: 'Audi-' to hear, (in Tamil -[கேள்](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/tamil-lex_query.py?page=1096)). Origin of Audit come from people ask why you did what you did and the other person justify why he did what he did. there is no rule to check against, or if it's not in the rule book you can't do as the X implies. it is the way X says that person doesn't know about the project mandates, nor the subject(technical details), nor The Audit it self. Otherwise they point exactly what the mandate/protocol/compliance clause says, so we can proceed to more meaningful conversation.

> B: it has two meaning, to ask, to hear
>
> A: yes we use Tamil as the meeting to communicate we get to the Tamil root analysis later.
>
> B: No, you said to hear when explaining Audit. It can be Ask as well.
>
> A: it is the cause create effect not other way around.&#x20;
>
> B: No we use 'கேள்'/(Kael) for both ask and hear.
>
> A: Yes the process is generate sound, travel through medium, then listened. Each has its name. Tamil too should have.
>
> B: No we use it for both
>
> A: We can't find root by what we day to day use, and the limits of what we know. To find tamil root words we need to find, understand etymology. Let's stick to Audi-

'கேள்' (Kael) என்ற தமிழ் வார்த்தைக்கு **'வினவு' (ask/inquire)**, **'கவனி' (listen/hear)**, அல்லது **'கேட்பது'** என்று பொருள். இது ஒருவரிடம் கேள்வி கேட்பதையோ அல்லது ஒரு விஷயத்தைக் காதுகொடுத்துக் கேட்பதையோ குறிக்கும். **முக்கியப் பொருட்கள்:**

* **வினவு / கேள்வி கேள் (Ask / Inquire):** ஒருவரிடம் தகவல் கேட்பது (எ.கா: அவனிடம் கேள்).
* **கவனி / கேட்டுக்கொள் (Listen / Hear):** சத்தம் அல்லது சொற்களைக் கேட்பது (எ.கா: நான் சொல்வதைக் கேள்).
* **கேட்பது / வேண்டுதல் (Request):** ஒன்றை வேண்டிப் பெறுவது.

**எடுத்துக்காட்டுகள்:**

* அவனை **கேள்** (Ask him).

The Tamil word 'Kael' means 'ask/inquire', 'listen/hear', or 'requesting'. This refers to either asking someone a question or listening to something attentively with the ears.

Main meanings:

* Ask / Inquire: Asking someone for information (e.g., Ask him).
* Listen / Hear: Hearing sounds or words (e.g., Listen to what I say).
* Requesting: Asking for and obtaining something.

Examples:

* Ask him.
* Listen to the song.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is same for Paleo or Keto too, when people know/hear these words first in diet context, they associate the word with that, partly because we learn superficially. Person who already introduced "Paleolithic Era"/"ketogenesis", should understand the diet better not other way.

### A Conversation About Understanding

**Setting:** Three colleagues discussing workplace terminology over lunch.

**Maya:** You know how Person X always talks about "audit and compliance" in meetings? I nod along, but I'm not entirely sure what they mean by it.

**James:** Same here. They make it sound like some rigid checklist we're failing to follow.

**Priya:** Let's actually figure it out instead of pretending we know. What does "audit" even mean?

**Maya:** Good question. I know what auditors _do_, but I've never thought about the word itself.

**James:** Wait—"audit" sounds like "audio," doesn't it? Auditorium, audition, audience...

**Priya:** You're right! They all start with "audi-". That can't be a coincidence.

**Maya:** Let me think... An audience watches a performance. An audition is where you perform to be judged. An auditorium is where people gather to listen to something.

**James:** So what's the common thread?

**Priya:** They all involve listening or hearing! An audience _hears_ the performance. In an audition, someone _hears_ you perform. An auditorium is designed for _hearing_ speakers or music.

**Maya:** Oh! So "audi-" must mean "to hear." Like in Latin—_audire_.

**James:** That makes sense. So "audit" comes from... hearing?

**Priya:** Think about it historically. An audit wasn't originally about checking boxes on a compliance form. It was about _listening_ to someone explain their accounts—asking "why did you spend this?" and _hearing_ their justification.

**Maya:** So it's more like a conversation than an interrogation against a rulebook?

**James:** That's completely different from how Person X uses it. They act like audit means finding violations of written rules.

**Priya:** Exactly. And that's the problem. When someone doesn't understand the root meaning, they reduce "audit" to rigid compliance checking. But real auditing is about listening to understand—asking "what happened here?" and evaluating the reasoning.

**Maya:** This explains why those meetings feel so frustrating. X isn't asking about our actual decisions or listening to our reasoning. They're just looking for rule violations that may not even apply to our project.

**James:** If they actually understood auditing, they'd ask us to explain our approach and evaluate whether our reasoning was sound—not just whether we checked every box.

***

### Reflection

This conversation illustrates a broader principle: **when we don't understand where words come from, we misunderstand the concepts they represent.**

"Audit" derives from the Latin _audire_ (to hear). Historically, auditing meant listening to someone's account of their stewardship—a dialogue where justifications were heard and evaluated. Only later did it become associated with formal compliance frameworks.

When we learn words only in narrow contexts—like "audit" solely as bureaucratic compliance—we miss their deeper meaning. This superficial learning leads to superficial application.

The same pattern appears everywhere:

* Someone hears "keto diet" without understanding _ketogenesis_ (the metabolic state)
* Someone learns "Paleolithic" only through diet fads, not geological eras
* Someone uses "audit" to mean "rule enforcement" rather than "reasoned examination"

**The lesson:** When you encounter specialized terms, trace them to their roots. Etymology isn't pedantic—it reveals the essential nature of concepts that get lost in modern usage.

***

### On Etymology and Translation

**A note on linguistic nuances:**

In exploring word roots across languages, we encounter interesting complexities. The Tamil word _கேள்_ (_kēḷ_) can mean both "ask" and "hear"—two concepts that English and Latin separate. This isn't a deficiency in Tamil; rather, it reflects a different conceptual framework where inquiry and listening are understood as connected aspects of the same communicative act.

When tracing etymology:

* Recognize that root meanings may separate concepts your native language combines
* Understand that different languages carve up conceptual space differently
* Avoid assuming one language's distinctions are more "correct" than another's

The goal isn't linguistic purity, but deeper understanding of the ideas words carry.

***

### Application

Next time someone invokes "audit," "compliance," or any specialized term in your workplace:

1. **Pause and ask:** "What does that word actually mean at its root?"
2. **Trace the etymology:** Where does this term come from, and what did it originally describe?
3. **Compare:** How does the original meaning differ from how it's being used now?
4. **Evaluate:** Is the modern usage an appropriate evolution, or has the core meaning been lost?

This practice doesn't just prevent miscommunication—it reveals when concepts have been corrupted or oversimplified in translation from one domain to another.

As Epictetus reminds us: we cannot learn what we think we already know. The first step to understanding is acknowledging that familiar words may carry meanings we've never truly examined.
