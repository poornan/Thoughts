> …Talking about diet
>
> A: Have you heard "paleo diet"
>
> B: No, but heard "keto diet"
>
> A: Okay what is it?
>
> B: It's a diet, reduce carbs.
>
> A: Okay what is "Keto"
>
> B: Don't know.
>
> … Conversation continues then lands in Office matters&#x20;
>
> C: The Person(X) always say Audit/Compliance
>
> A: Yes, don't know what they mean. What do you understand&#x20;
>
> C: Don't know thats what the person says
>
> A: Okay, let's understand. we can guess it's roots. Find any similar sounding words
>
> … after a minute or two
>
> A: Think like Audio&#x20;
>
> B: Auditorium, Audition&#x20;
>
> C: Audience
>
> A: Let's take Audience for instance, what the Tamil meaning?
>
> C: Parvaiyalar \[பார்வையாளர் (Pārvaiyāḷar)]
>
> A: Okay, we'll come back to it. but, it's not the proper translation to the root meaning of Audience. So what could be the root meaning of the group of words we have now?
>
> …
>
> C: Nothing common- Audition is about participating in contest, auditorium is a place people attend events, Audience is who watch the show/stand up comedy /speech
>
> A: There is something common like the "Audi-" in common
>
> B: All are different words different meaning&#x20;
>
> A: yes it is, yet it has something in common. it's the root, from where it branch from
>
> B: didn't get it&#x20;
>
> A: Audi-o, Audi-torium, Audi-tion, Audi-ence. "Audi" is the common root, then with each suffix the meaning changes. What is it?
>
> C: Nope
>
> B: Nope
>
> A: 'Audi-' to hear, (in Tamil -[கேள்](https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/tamil-lex_query.py?page=1096)). Origin of Audit come from people ask why you did what you did and the other person justify why he did what he did. there is no rule to check against, or if it's not in the rule book you can't do as the X implies. it is the way X says that person doesn't know about the project mandates, nor the subject(technical details), nor The Audit it self. Otherwise they point exactly what the mandate/protocol/compliance clause says, so we can proceed to more meaningful conversation.
>
> B: it has two meaning, to ask, to hear
>
> A: yes we use Tamil as the meeting to communicate we get to the Tamil root analysis later.
>
> B: No, you said to hear when explaining Audit. It can be Ask as well.
>
> A: it is the cause create effect not other way around.&#x20;
>
> B: No we use 'கேள்'/(Kael) for both ask and hear.
>
> A: Yes the process is generate sound, travel through medium, then listened. Each has its name. Tamil too should have.
>
> B: No we use it for both
>
> A: We can't find root by what we day to day use, and the limits of what we know. To find tamil root words we need to find, understand etymology. Let's stick to Audi-
>
> B: you didn't understand what I say
>
> A: Yes, please explain otherwise I won't. First conclude root word for english Audi and the origins of Audit.

It is same for Paleo or Keto too, when people know/hear these words first in diet context, they associate the word with that, partly because we learn superficially. Person who already introduced "Paleolithic Era"/"ketogenesis", should understand the diet better not other way.
