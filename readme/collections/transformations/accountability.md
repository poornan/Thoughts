# Accountability

> **Accountability** is a misunderstood concept. The Center for Creative Leadership defines accountability:
>
> > Whereas _responsibility_ is generally delegated by the boss, the organization, or by virtue of position, _accountability_ is having an _intrinsic sense of ownership_ of the task and the willingness to face the consequences that come with success or failure.

> Furthermore, accountable people “look out the window to apportion credit . . . when things go well, \[and] they look in the mirror to apportion responsibility . . . when things go poorly.”[11](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/p/leadership-is-getting-results-in-2f3#footnote-11-143858654) In other words, _when failures occur, actively seek full responsibility for anything we could have influenced_ — we do not seek blame or look to “hold someone accountable” — we problem-solve and ask “how can I (or we) make things better?” _Then_, we can seek to improve the processes and systems that support self-accountability (including for teams) in a way that inspires trust.
