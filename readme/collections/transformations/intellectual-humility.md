# Intellectual humility

> **Intellectual humility** is recognizing and owning your intellectual limitations in service of pursuing deeper knowledge, truth, and understanding through curiosity and inquiry.[13](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/p/leadership-is-getting-results-in-2f3#footnote-13-143858654) Intellectual humility generates and amplifies the growth mindset.[14](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/p/leadership-is-getting-results-in-2f3#footnote-14-143858654)

They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and put more energy into learning.”

> The **Four Stages of Competence**[16](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/p/leadership-is-getting-results-in-2f3#footnote-16-143858654)[17](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/p/leadership-is-getting-results-in-2f3#footnote-17-143858654) are critical to understanding how we learn and how we support how others to learn and grow (Figure 2). On the learning journey, **Stage 2** (conscious incompetence) can be _very_ stressful and can result in avoidance, resistance, quitting — and even chronic stress. _We might get or feel stuck here because of the expectations we or others have of our performance_. **Stage 4** masters, not remembering when they were newbies, can unintentionally pile on the stress on Stage 2 learners. Stage 4 masters, smug in their effortless expertise, might be ignorant of their incompetencies in other domains. The solution is to always stay humble, patient, and compassionate of ourselves and others.!

> The **Networked Talent Model** summarizes four competency domains that are essential to short and long-term career success. Formal education, training, and practice is a key path to occupational mastery. Management is _getting things done_. Leadership is _leading change by inspiring and influencing others to commit, align, and act towards a shared goal or mission_. Management tasks can be delegated. Leadership is about relationships and it cannot be delegated. Team skills are the interpersonal skills necessary to be an effective team member and leader.
