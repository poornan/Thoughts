# Privilege

> **Privilege** is _a form of unearned power that comes from social advantage_. All of us have some form of privilege. Privilege exists because of cultural norms and sociopolitical systems that generate and reinforce power inequities. For example, in the US, if one is male, heterosexual, cisgender, or has lighter skin color, then one has more privilege. We do not choose privilege, but we can acknowledge it. One can make “the noble choice to forgo your status and to use your influence for the good of others before yourself” — [this is humility.](../external-resources/privilege-refs.md)
