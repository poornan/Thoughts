> Dave Snowden uses the distinction between Pareto and Gaussian (normal) distributions to illustrate different dynamics in complex systems. He highlights that while many business and management approaches assume a Gaussian distribution (with predictable outcomes and a focus on averages), real-world situations, particularly in complex or chaotic domains, often follow a Pareto distribution, characterized by a few high-impact events and many minor ones.
>
> In complex systems, the Pareto distribution is more typical. This means that relying on averages and ignoring outliers is a flawed strategy. Instead, one needs to focus on understanding the drivers of the few high-impact events and managing the system accordingly.
>
> In a Pareto world, strategies cannot be based solely on probability assessments. Safe-to-fail experiments and understanding the dynamics of the system are more appropriate.
