# The warrior doesn't chase battles.

The warrior doesn't chase battles. But when the storm comes, he stands where others kneel - not to fight, but to become. — Kenshin

***

> He lives to transform.\
> It’s not about swinging the sword — it’s about knowing when to sheath it.\
> Not about winning every war — but choosing the ones that shape the soul.\
> The world will throw chaos, doubt, fear — and still, the warrior rises.\
> Not louder, but clearer.\
> Not hardened, but wiser.\
> He doesn’t need a crown or applause.\
> The fire in his chest is proof enough.\
> You don’t become a warrior by surviving.\
> You become one by awakening through the fire — and returning with peace.
