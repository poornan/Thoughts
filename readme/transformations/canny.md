# Canny

> _The increasing imposition of bureaucratic structure resulted in humans building informal networks (Snowden, 2002) to make the systems work despite itself. Humans are, to use a wonderful Scottish dialect word, canny; they find ways around problems, they learn to conform on the surface while taking a more naturalistic approach behind the facades of formalism. One of the many problems is that these workarounds disguise failure to the point where when the system collapses it does so catastrophically._
