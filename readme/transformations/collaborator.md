> **Trustworthiness** are _attributes_ of the **trustee** that drive their reasoning, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that may directly or indirectly impact the trustor and the trustor’s willingness to extend trust. The trustee’s trustworthiness is determined by evidence of their character, caring, competence, and consistency.
