# Inherit Universal Values

> **Universal values** are values that apply to everyone, everywhere, leaving no one behind, including your adversaries. Examples of universal values include dignity, equity/fairness, compassion, and belonging. Dr. Monica Sharma, former Director of Leadership Development at the United Nations, discovered that promoting the universal values of **dignity**, **equity**, and **compassion** enabled field teams to tackle difficult public health problems in all corners of the world.[12](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/p/leadership-is-getting-results-in-2f3#footnote-12-143858654)
>
> Embody and promote universal values in every conversation and in every interaction. With universal values,
>
> * we can **connect** with others through our **shared humanity**,
> * we can **transcend differences** to find **common ground**, and
> * we can **co-create** to **solve problems** together.
>
> Promoting universal values and cultivating humility work together to activate a mindset for authentic caring and connection.
