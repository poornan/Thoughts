# Leadership

While there are many definitions of leadership,[5](https://teampublichealth.substack.com/p/leadership-is-getting-results-in-2f3#footnote-5-143858654) this is one of my favorites because it’s easy to remember and easy to operationalize.

1. _Leadership_
2. _is getting_ (inputs and processes)
3. _results_ (outputs, outcomes, and impacts)
4. _in a way_ (observable behaviors that model “who you/we are”)
5. _that inspires_ (“connecting to why” = vision, purpose, mission, goal)
6. _**trust**_ (culture that is safe to take risks, learn, improve, and innovate).
