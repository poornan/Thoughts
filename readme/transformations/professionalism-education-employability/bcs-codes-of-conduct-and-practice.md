# BCS Codes of Conduct and Practice

Observed by every BCS member, it defines the characteristics we share as practitioners serious about building a responsible computing profession.

By signing up to the code when you join BCS, you show your commitment to working in the public interest - you accept your professional duty. It's the very foundation of our profession, built upon every day by the competence, integrity and diversity of our members.

The BCS Code of Conduct and Practice outlines ethical and professional standards for members of BCS, [The Chartered Institute for IT](https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/). It covers areas like public interest, professional competence and integrity, duty to relevant authorities, and duty to the profession. The code emphasizes upholding the reputation of the profession, acting with integrity, and ensuring professional competence.

Key aspects of the BCS Code of Conduct and Practice:

* **Public Interest:**&#x4D;embers must consider the public health, safety, privacy, security, and well-being of others and the environment. They should also promote equal access to the benefits of IT and inclusion of all sectors of society.&#x20;
* **Professional Competence and Integrity:**&#x4D;embers must maintain and enhance their professional knowledge, skills, and competence, staying updated on relevant technological developments and standards. They should not claim expertise they do not possess and should act with integrity in their professional activities.&#x20;
* **Duty to Relevant Authority:**&#x4D;embers are expected to carry out their work with due care and diligence, in accordance with the requirements of their employer or client (relevant authority). They should avoid conflicts of interest, protect confidential information, and accept responsibility for their work and that of their subordinates.&#x20;
* **Duty to the Profession:**&#x4D;embers have a responsibility to uphold the reputation of the IT profession and the BCS. They should participate in the development, use, and enforcement of professional standards and act with integrity in their professional relationships.&#x20;

In essence, the BCS Code of Conduct and Practice provides a framework for IT professionals to act ethically, competently, and responsibly in their work and contribute to the advancement of the profession.&#x20;
