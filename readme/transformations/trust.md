“Teams succeed because they are exceedingly human” - Patrick Lencioni

“**Trust** is the willingness of a party \[**trustor**] to be vulnerable to the actions of another party \[**trustee**] based on the expectation that the other party will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party.

* **Credibility** = whether you perceive the other person as credible (as in, how I perceive their competence/capability in relation to what they are doing or saying, eg Do I trust what they say on a given topic?), &#x20;
* **Reliability** = whether you perceive the other person as reliable (eg Do I trust that they will do what they say they will do?),
* **Intimacy** = whether you perceive that it is safe to entrust someone with information about myself (eg How willing am I to reveal to them my vulnerability, doubts, or feelings? Do they know me the human being? Or just some work caricature of me? Do they care about me and my well-being? Will they be 100% candid with me, and vice versa?), and
* **Self-Orientation** = whether you perceive that someone’s focus is primarily on themselves or on others (eg Do they care for others, or do I perceive them as looking out for their own interests? Stephen Covey calls this last quality ‘intent’. A person assessing your intent will wonder, ‘Are you thinking about yourself, or others, in this situation?’)
