# Trust

{% hint style="info" %}
“**Trust** is the willingness of a party \[**trustor**] to be vulnerable to the actions of another party \[**trustee**] based on the expectation that the other party will perform a particular action important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party.
{% endhint %}

* **Credibility** = whether you perceive the other person as credible (as in, how I perceive their competence/capability in relation to what they are doing or saying, eg Do I trust what they say on a given topic?), &#x20;
* **Reliability** = whether you perceive the other person as reliable (eg Do I trust that they will do what they say they will do?),
* **Intimacy** = whether you perceive that it is safe to entrust someone with information about myself (eg How willing am I to reveal to them my vulnerability, doubts, or feelings? Do they know me the human being? Or just some work caricature of me? Do they care about me and my well-being? Will they be 100% candid with me, and vice versa?), and
* **Self-Orientation** = whether you perceive that someone’s focus is primarily on themselves or on others (eg Do they care for others, or do I perceive them as looking out for their own interests? Stephen Covey calls this last quality ‘intent’. A person assessing your intent will wonder, ‘Are you thinking about yourself, or others, in this situation?’)

This diagram explains how to build trust quickly and well. Trust is required for executive promotion. Who would promote someone they do not trust?

Most people understand:

\--Credibility: You know what you are doing

\--Reliability: You do what you say

Intimacy is harder. Do the people feel that you care? That you are rational, reasonable, and kind?

And then there is Self-Orientation - are you doing all you do for your own good or to help them?

This last one is why the most trust is built the fastest between soldiers in war:

\--If a soldier risks their life for you then their self-orientation is very low, creating a ton of trust.

\--If a solider refuses to risk themselves to help you, you will never trust them again.

The closest equivalent to "war" in the work world is crisis situations. Places where you can speak up, show up, stay late, and generally go above and beyond to help someone. That builds trust.

Trust is both logical AND emotional. Both what your actions show AND how you make me feel.

To build trust with leaders, coworkers, and your team, you need to both do what you say and act in a consistent personable and professional manner.

If some days you are moody, grumpy, and short while others you are a ray of sunshine, you will not build deep trust even if you always deliver.

And of course, being friendly and well liked will not maintain trust if you routinely fail to deliver!

Have a great weekend. I trust you will!
