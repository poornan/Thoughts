### The Eisenhower Matrix

This has limited usage in Complex Adaptive System context; because important or not is decided using Gaussian distribution, more on [#pareto-and-gaussian-normal-distributions](value-contribution-matrix.md#pareto-and-gaussian-normal-distributions "mention")

> The Eisenhower Matrix, also referred to as Urgent-Important Matrix, helps you decide on and prioritize tasks by urgency and importance, sorting out less urgent and important tasks which you should either delegate or not do at all.

### Pareto and Gaussian (normal) distributions

> Dave Snowden uses the distinction between Pareto and Gaussian (normal) distributions to illustrate different dynamics in complex systems. He highlights that while many business and management approaches assume a Gaussian distribution (with predictable outcomes and a focus on averages), real-world situations, particularly in complex or chaotic domains, often follow a Pareto distribution, characterized by a few high-impact events and many minor ones.
>
> In complex systems, the Pareto distribution is more typical. This means that relying on averages and ignoring outliers is a flawed strategy. Instead, one needs to focus on understanding the drivers of the few high-impact events and managing the system accordingly.
>
> In a Pareto world, strategies cannot be based solely on probability assessments. Safe-to-fail experiments and understanding the dynamics of the system are more appropriate.

### The Six Levels of Customer Service (Uplifting Service)

> 1. Criminal service
>
> Criminal service is really bad. It’s service that violates even minimum expectations, the kind of service that your customers remember never to use again, and are angry enough to call you and complain about.
>
> 2. Basic Service
>
> Basic service is disappointing. It’s the point of frustration that can turn into anger—but when it’s over the customer is not disappointed enough to complain. However, he will tell his friends, and will remember not to call you for that kind of service again.
>
> 3. Expected Service
>
> Expected service is nothing special. It’s the average, the usual, the norm. The customer might come back to you, but only if no better options exist.
>
> 4. Desired Service
>
> Desired service is what your customers hope for and prefer. They’ll do business with your organization again because you do things for them just the way they like it.
>
> 5. Surprising Service
>
> Surprising service is something special, like an unexpected gift. It gives your customers more than they expected. This makes you an organization that customers enjoy and will come back to again and again.
>
> 6. Unbelievable Service
>
> Unbelievable service is astonishingly fantastic. This is the level of service your customers can’t forget, the legendary treatment they will tell all their friends about. Can you see where your service stands today? Great. Now consider this: Each level of service is just like a step in a staircase. Companies that truly understand the power of great service are continuously looking for ways to climb to the next level. But here’s the rub: Moving up is not another step on a solid staircase; it’s like trying to climb up a down escalator. Each level is consistently sliding downward because your competitors are also working to raise their service. One day you offer surprising service, but the next day everyone in your industry is doing the same thing—oops, you just slipped down to Desired. Wait another day, and oops, you just fell to Expected. The next thing you know, you’re the cassette player of service trying to compete with the iPod. Keep your service stepping up, or find yourself lying in the dust. How can you step up your service? Three ways. First, keep service improvement as a key focus of your business. Don’t just hit the service target; aim for one or two steps higher. Next, ask your customers what else they would like, appreciate, or value. What are you not yet doing that they would love you for if you did? Finally, benchmark your competition and those outside your industry. What’s new in one arena soon finds its way to others. Read the original article about the six levels of customer service at

### What is System 1 and System 2 Thinking?

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> System 1 and System 2 thinking describes two distinct modes of cognitive processing introduced by Daniel Kahneman in his book Thinking, Fast and Slow. System 1 is fast, automatic, and intuitive, operating with little to no effort. This mode of thinking allows us to make quick decisions and judgments based on patterns and experiences. In contrast, System 2 is slow, deliberate, and conscious, requiring intentional effort. This type of thinking is used for complex problem-solving and analytical tasks where more thought and consideration are necessary.

### Complicated vs Complex

> In the context of strategy, the key distinction within Cynefin is that between systems that are complicated and those that are complex. The former can be engineered and diagnosis can be separated from intervention, the latter cannot and all diagnostic attempts are a priori interventions and vice versa.

### Recipes vs Chefs&#x20;

> A simple metaphor will allow us to understand the danger of the case based, structured approaches that have dominated the last few decades; namely that of the recipe book user and the chef. If you employ a recipe book user to cook a meal for you, then your kitchen will have to be engineered to match a standard design. All the ingredients will be lined up in appropriate sized bowls and, as long as nothing unexpected happens you will get a reasonable meal. The Chef on the other hand enters your kitchen and creates a wonderful meal from whatever happens to be lying around. This is not to say that recipe books do not have utility, or that the chef will not use them from time to time. The point is that the chef is resilient and adaptive in changing contexts; the recipe book is not. The reason for this is that, to reference Aristotle, the chef has both _sophia_ and _pronesis_, the ability to reflect and the knowledge built through a long apprenticeship and an understanding of the basic principles of taste and nutrition; wisdom both reflective and practical, institutionalized in social practice and expectation.
>
>
>
> Put bluntly, the emphasis on engineering best practice and case based approaches to management science over the last few decades has produced an over dependence on recipes, and a paucity of chefs. Rectification of this is a matter of necessity in a resource-starved future confronted by increasing levels of uncertainty and less and less time to react or intervene before events get out of hand. The purpose of this chapter however is not to declare the engineering approach apostate and establish cognitive complexity<sup>1</sup> as a new religious orthodoxy. Rather it is to legitimize such approaches, within the boundaries of Ordered Systems, where cause and effect relationships exist, can be discovered and which repeat. On the other side of the boundary however we have a whole new class of un-ordered<sup>2</sup> systems that require the adaptability of the chef, rather than the predictability of the recipe book.

### Resilience vs Robustness

> Resilience for the purposes of this chapter is defined as the capacity to recover quickly from failure (including the consequences of external change outside of the decision maker’s control), and robustness as the capacity to resist failure. Taking a strategic approach based on resilience also implies the early detection of signs of failure to minimize the energy cost of recovery. The signs of potential success, or success through failure, also require early detection to reduce energy costs of amplification. Robustness under this definition requires a degree of foresight; we have to anticipate the likely range of events with which we will have to deal and that, as we will see, is highly problematic under conditions of uncertainty.
